mordor as depicted in the peter jackson film in j r r tolkien s fictional universe of middle earth mordor is the dwelling place of sauron in the southeast of middle earth to the east of anduin the great river frodo and sam went there to destroy the one ring mordor was unique because of the three enormous mountain ridges surrounding it from the north from the west and from the south that protected this land from an unexpected invasion by any of the people living in those directions geography location of mordor in middle earth marked in red mordor was protected from three sides by mountain ranges arranged roughly rectangularly ered lithui in the north ephel d ath in the west and an unnamed or possibly still called ephel d ath range in the south in the northwest corner of mordor the deep valley of ud n was the only entrance for large armies and that is where sauron built the black gate of mordor although it is possible this gate was built by either elves or numenoreans with the intention of keeping evil within mordor in front of the morannon lay the dagorlad or the battle plain sauron s main fortress barad d r was at the foothills of ered lithui to southwest of barad d r lay the arid plateau of gorgoroth and mount doom to the east lay the plain of lithlad a narrow pass led through ephel d ath and the fortress of minas morgul earlier minas ithil was guarding that an even more difficult pass was guarded by the giant spider shelob and the fortress of cirith ungol another known fortress was durthang in northern ephel d ath the southern part of mordor n rn was slightly more fertile and moist enough to carry the inland sea of n rnen nurn was made somewhat fertile because the ash blown from mount doom left its soil nutrient rich thus allowing dry land farming unfortunately the inland sea of n rn was salty not freshwater to the west of mordor was the narrow land of ithilien with the city of osgiliath and the great river anduin to the northeast rh n and to the southeast khand formation mordor was a relic of the devastating works of morgoth apparently formed by massive volcanic eruptions it was given the name mordor already before sauron settled there because of its volcano orodruin and its eruptions sauron however was the first to settle there history see also timeline of arda early history sauron settled in mordor one zero zero zero years after the end of the first age and it remained the pivot of his evil contemplations for the whole of the second and third ages of middle earth in the north western corner of this land stood mount doom or orodruin where sauron had forged the one ring near orodruin stood sauron s stronghold barad d r after this time sauron was known as the dark lord of mordor for two five zero zero years sauron ruled mordor uninterruptedly having wrought the ring it was from there that he launched the attack upon the elves of eregion he was repelled by the men of n menor he fought against the men again almost a thousand years later that time he was captured by the n men reans and brought to their island kingdom eventually causing its destruction see akallab th immediately after n menor s destruction sauron returned to mordor as a spirit and resumed his rule the last alliance and third age sauron s rule was interrupted yet again when his efforts to overthrow the surviving men and elves failed and they fought their way back to their foe s domain after several years of siege forces of the last alliance of elves and men came into mordor sauron was defeated in a final battle on the slopes of orodruin for about a thousand years mordor was guarded by gondor to prevent any evil forces from breaking out casualties from the great plague during the reign of king telemnar were so high that fortifications guarding mordor were abandoned as the troops were called back to gondor s cities deprived of guard mordor began to fill with evil things again minas ithil was conquered by the nine ringwraiths other fortifications that were supposed to defend gondor from the menace inside mordor were turned into a means of shielding mordor by the time sauron returned into mordor after his false defeat in dol guldur in the events that took place at the time of bilbo baggins s quest mordor was protected too well to be captured by any military might that was available in middle earth at the end of the third age in the north of mordor during the war of the ring were the great garrisons and forges of war while surrounding the bitter inland sea of n rnen to the south lay the vast fields tended for the provision of the armies by hordes of slaves brought in from lands to the east and south war of the ring during the war of the ring sauron gathered all his forces to mordor after the battle of the pelennor fields a host of the west went to the black gate sauron sent his army to destroy the men of gondor and rohan but then frodo baggins destroyed the one ring and mordor fell the dark tower the black gate and the towers of teeth collapsed to ruin mount doom exploded both sauron and his ringwraiths were apparently destroyed after the ultimate defeat of sauron mordor became mostly empty again as the orcs inside it fled or were killed crippled by thousands of years of abuse and neglect but capable of sustaining life the land of mordor was given to the defeated foes of gondor as a consolation as well as to the freed slaves of nurn who were formerly forced to farm there to feed the armies of mordor naming mordor actually has two meanings the black land in tolkien s contrived language sindarin and the land of shadow in quenya the root mor dark black also appears in moria dor land also appears in gondor stone land and doriath fenced land the quenya word for shadow is mordo a proposed etymology out of the context of middle earth is old english mor or which means mortal sin or murder the latter meaning is descended from the former it is not uncommon for names in tolkien s fiction to have relevant meanings in several languages both those invented by tolkien and real ones but this of course happens with any two languages mordor is also a name cited in some nordic mythologies referring to a land where its citizens practise evil without knowing it imposed on themselves by the society long created for that purpose this quite fits with tolkien s mordor in the atlas of middle earth karen wynn fonstad assumed that the lands of mordor khand and rh n lay where the inland sea of helcar had been and that the sea of rh n and sea of n rnen were its remnants the atlas was however published before the peoples of middle earth where it turned out that the sea of rh n and mordor existed already in the first age compare moria other meanings of the name mordor is a metal band it is the name of a computer game it is the name of a series of muds originally inspired by scepter of goth realms of middle earth the m naghten rules are used to establish insanity as an excuse to potential criminal liability but the definitional criteria establish insanity in the legal and not the psychological sense the guidelines were formulated by the house of lords in m naghten s case one eight four three one zero c not guilty by reason of insanity and the sentence is either a mandatory and indeterminate period of treatment in a secure hospital facility or at the discretion of the court depending on the country the defence is recognized in australia canada england and wales new zealand the republic of ireland and most u s states with the exception of montana idaho and utah explanation insanity as a defence operates as an excuse i e it excludes the accused from the process of a trial which makes it consistent with public policies about criminal responsibility and the function of criminal law at one level it is a rationale of compassion accepting that it is morally wrong to treat a person as criminal if because of severe mental illness or intellectual disability he or she is temporarily or permanently deprived of the capacity either to choose whether to obey law or to distinguish right from wrong this may suggest that the insanity provisions operate at the most fundamental level to negate the mens rea element in any offense cf doli incapax in which children are excused from criminal liability due to a presumed incapacity to form a criminal intent a more utilitarian justification for criminalizing any given behavior is as a deterrent yet if this class of potential offender is genuinely insane no law or threat of punishment will be effective as a deterrent indeed if the state is seen to punish the mentally ill this may actually undermine public confidence in the penal system thus the better rationale for the choice of compulsory medical treatment is a general social duty to encourage rehabilitation in states where the consequence of satisfying the rules was indefinite detention insanity was rarely invoked when the accused was charged with a relatively minor offense it was better to plead to the charge and receive a determinate prison sentence hence insanity was mainly used in murder cases where the threat of capital punishment offered a genuine incentive to plead insanity as an alternative to death the fact that murder no longer carries a capital sentence in the majority of countries may remove the incentive to plead it assuming no change in the dispositional powers of the court after a successful insanity defence a practical issue is whether the fact that an accused is laboring under a mental disability should be a necessary but not sufficient condition for negating responsibility i e whether the test should also require an incapacity to understand what is being done to know that what one is doing is wrong or to control an impulse to do something and so demonstrate a causal link between the disability and the potentially criminal acts and omissions for example the irish insanity defence comprises the m naghten rules and a control test which asks whether the accused was debarred from refraining from committing the act because of a defect of reason due to mental illness see doyle v wicklow county council one nine seven four five five ir seven one but the butler committee in england recommended that proof of severe mental disorder should be sufficient to negate responsibility in effect creating an irrebuttable presumption of irresponsibility arising from proof of a severe mental disorder this has been criticized as it assumes a lack of criminal responsibility simply because there is evidence of some sort of mental dysfunctioning rather than establishing a standard of criminal responsibility the law should be geared to culpability not mere psychiatric diagnosis the rules in english law the jurors ought to be told in all cases that every man is presumed to be sane and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction burden of proof this is a rebuttable presumption and the burden of proof is on the party wishing to rebut if a jury think it is more likely than not that the is insane within the meaning of the rules the defendant is entitled to a verdict in his favor the common law rule based on lord denning s judgement in bratty v attorney general for northern ireland one nine six three ac three eight six is that wherever the defendant makes an issue of his or her state of mind during a trial the prosecution can adduce evidence of his insanity in r v clarke one nine seven two one aer two one nine a woman charged with a minor s one theft claimed she had no mens rea because she had absent mindedly walked out of the shop without paying when the prosecution began to adduce evidence under the rules she changed her plea to guilty on appeal the conviction was quashed and the general rule of practice introduced to limit the prosecution s ability to introduce the rules to cases in which the defect of reason was substantial the test and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity it must be clearly proved that at the time of the committing of the act the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing or if he did know it that he did not know what he was doing was wrong given that the test examines the accused s knowledge and understanding the focus is on mens rea issues in dpp v harper one nine nine seven it was held that insanity is not generally a defence to strict liability offences in this instance the accused was driving with excess alcohol by definition the accused is sufficiently aware of the nature of the activity to commit the actus reus of driving and presumably knows that driving while drunk is legally wrong any other feature of the accused s knowledge is irrelevant at the time the focus of interest is the state of mind at the time the accused engages in behavior resulting in a criminal outcome it is irrelevant that as a result of treatment the accused may be entirely sane at the time the matter comes before a court disease of the mind whether a particular condition amounts to a disease of the mind within the rules is not a medical but a legal question to be decided in accordance with the ordinary rules of interpretation it seems that any disease which produces a malfunctioning of the mind is a disease of the mind and need not be a disease of the brain it covers any internal as opposed to external disorder which results in violence and is likely to recur r v kemp one nine five seven one qb three nine nine arteriosclerosis or a hardening of the arteries caused loss of control during which the defendant attacked his wife with a hammer this was an internal condition and a disease of the mind r v sullivan one nine eight four ac one five six during an epileptic episode the defendant caused grievous bodily harm epilepsy was an internal condition and a disease of the mind and the fact that the state was transitory was irrelevant r v quick we accept that sleep is a normal condition but the evidence in the instant case indicates that sleepwalking and particularly violence in sleep is not normal more generally see automatism case law defect of reason the disease of the mind must have given rise to a defect of reason which had one of two consequences either a the defendant did not know the nature and quality of his act or b he did not know his act was wrong thus the requirement is that the defendant s power to reason is impaired in a substantial way r v clarke one nine seven two one aer two one nine confirms that this must be something more than a state of confusion or absentmindedness more interesting is whether the rules should be invoked in cases involving the battered woman syndrome nature and quality of the actions this phrase refers to the physical nature and quality of the act rather than the moral quality it covers the situation where the defendant does not know what he is physically doing kenny gives the example of a madman who cuts a woman s throat believing that he is cutting a loaf of bread knowledge that the act was wrong this requirement is a reference to the law rather than the morality the defendant must not know that he was doing something legally wrong delusions the judges were asked in m naghten s case if a person could be excused if he committed an offence in consequence of an insane delusion they replied that if he labors under such partial delusion only and is not in other respects insane he must be considered in the same situation as to responsibility as if the facts with respect to which the delusion exists were real this rule requires the court to take the facts as the accused believed them to be if the delusions do not prevent the defendant from having mens rea there will be no defence in r v bell one nine eight four clr six eight five the defendant used a van to smash through the entrance gates of a holiday camp because it was like a secret society in there i wanted to do my bit against it as instructed by god it was held that as the defendant had been aware of his actions he could not have been in a state of automatism nor insane and the fact that he believed that god had told him to do this merely provided an explanation of his motive and did not prevent him from knowing that what he was doing was wrong in the legal sense specific conditions may induce the delusions the court in r v windle one nine five two accepted that folie a deux may cause a defect of reason over a period of many years a husband who had acted as a carer for his wife who had a mental illness came to share similar symptoms the jury s one criminal procedure insanity and unfitness to plead act one nine nine one provides that a jury shall not return a special verdict that the accused is not guilty by reason of insanity except on the written or oral evidence of two or more registered medical practitioners of whom at least one has special experience in the field of mental disorder this may require the jury to decide between conflicting medical evidence which they are not necessarily equipped to do but the law goes further and allows them to disagree with the experts if there are facts or surrounding circumstances which in the opinion of the court justify the jury in coming to that conclusion sentencing under s three act one nine nine one where the sentence for the offence to which the finding relates is fixed by law e g murder the court must make a hospital order restricting discharge without limitation of time otherwise if there is adequate medical evidence and the defendant has been convicted of an imprisonable offense a hospital order requires that the defendant be admitted to and detained in a hospital for treatment for a mental disorder see ss three seven four three mental health act one nine eight three in any other case

in greek metera mother and polis city town is a major city which is an economical and cultural center for some country or larger region and usually an important hub for international connections the word comes from the greek metropolis mother city pl metropoleis which is how the greek colonies of antiquity referred to their original cities with whom they retained cultic and political cultural connections the word was used in post classical latin for the chief city of a province the seat of the government and in particular ecclesiastically for the seat or see of a metropolitan bishop to whom suffragan bishops were responsible this usage equates the province with the diocese or episcopal see in modern usage the word is also used for a metropolitan area a set of adjacent and interconnected cities clustered around a major urban center in this sense metropolitan usually means spanning the whole metropolis as in metropolitan administration or proper of a metropolis as in metropolitan life and opposed to provincial or rural global world city the concept of global city or world city means a city that has a direct and tangible effect on global affairs through socioeconomic cultural and or political means the term has become increasingly familiar because of the rise of globalization i e global finance communications and travel an attempt to define and categorise world cities by financial criteria was made by the globalization and world cities study group advanced producer services such as accountancy advertising finance and law the inventory identifies three levels of world cities and several sub ranks see world cities ranking a metropolis isn t necessarily a global city or being one it could not be among the top ranking due to its poor standards of living development and lack of infrastructures united states in the united states an incorporated area or group of areas having a population more than five zero zero zero zero is required to have a metropolitan planning organization in order to facilitate major infrastructure projects and to ensure financial solubility thus a population of five zero zero zero zero or greater has been used as a de facto standard in the united states to define a metropolis a similar definition is used by the united states census bureau they define a metropolitan statistical area as at least one urbanized area of five zero zero zero zero or more inhabitants united kingdom various conurbations in the united kingdom are considered to be metropolitan areas see metropolitan county and list of

links u s census bureau about metropolitan and micropolitan statistics one of the remarkable characteristics of the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics which distinguishes it from mathematical formulations of theories developed prior to the early one nine zero zero s is its use of abstract mathematical structures such as hilbert spaces and operators on these spaces many of these structures had not even been considered before the twentieth century in a general sense they are drawn from functional analysis a subject within pure mathematics that developed in parallel with and was influenced by the needs of quantum mechanics in brief physical quantities such as energy and momentum were no longer considered as functions on some phase space but as operators on such functions this formulation of quantum mechanics called canonical quantization continues to be used today and still forms the basis of ab initio calculations in atomic molecular and solid state physics at the heart of the description is an idea of quantum state which for systems of atomic scale is radically different from the previous models of physical reality while the mathematics is a complete description and permits calculation of many quantities that can be measured experimentally there is a definite limit to access for an observer with macroscopic instruments this limitation was first elucidated by heisenberg through a thought experiment and is represented mathematically by the non commutativity of quantum observables prior to the emergence of quantum mechanics as a separate theory the mathematics used in physics consisted mainly of differential geometry and partial differential equations probability theory was used in statistical mechanics geometric intuition clearly played a strong role in the first two and accordingly theories of relativity were formulated entirely in terms of geometric concepts the phenomenology of quantum physics arose roughly between one eight nine five and one nine one five and for the one zero to one five years before the emergence of quantum theory around one nine two five physicists continued to think of quantum theory within the confines of what is now called classical physics and in particular within the same mathematical structures the most sophisticated example of this is the sommerfeld wilson ishiwara quantization rule which was formulated entirely on the classical phase space history of the formalism the old quantum theory and the need for new mathematics main article old quantum theory in the decade of one eight nine zero planck was able to derive the blackbody spectrum and solve the classical ultraviolet catastrophe by making the unorthodox assumption that in the interaction of radiation with matter energy could only be exchanged in discrete units which he called quanta planck postulated a direct proportionality between the frequency of radiation and the quantum of energy at that frequency the proportionality constant h is now called planck s constant in his honour in one nine zero five einstein explained certain features of the photoelectric effect by assuming that planck s light quanta were actual particles which he called photons a sketch to justify spectroscopy observations for hydrogen atoms in one nine one three bohr calculated the spectrum of the hydrogen atom with the help of a new model of the atom in which the electron could orbit the proton only on a discrete set of classical orbits determined by the condition that angular momentum was an integer multiple of planck s constant electrons could make quantum leaps from one orbit to another emitting or absorbing single quanta of light at the right frequency all of these developments were phenomenological and flew in the face of the theoretical physics of the time bohr and sommerfeld went on to modify classical mechanics in an attempt to deduce the bohr model from first principles they proposed that of all closed classical orbits traced by a mechanical system in its phase space only the ones that enclosed an area which was a multiple of planck s constant were actually allowed the most sophisticated version of this formalism was the so called sommerfeld wilson ishiwara quantization although the bohr model of the hydrogen atom could be explained in this way the spectrum of the helium atom classically an unsolvable three body problem could not be predicted the mathematical status of quantum theory remained uncertain for some time in one nine two three de broglie proposed that wave particle duality applied not only to photons but to electrons and every other physical system the situation changed rapidly in the years one nine two five one nine three zero when working mathematical foundations were found through the groundbreaking work of erwin schr dinger and werner heisenberg and the foundational work of john von neumann hermann weyl and paul dirac and it became possible to unify several different approaches in terms of a fresh set of ideas the new quantum theory erwin schr dinger s wave mechanics originally was the first successful attempt at replicating the observed quantization of atomic spectra with the help of a precise mathematical realization of de broglie s wave particle duality schr dinger proposed an equation now bearing his name for the wave associated to an electron in an atom according to de broglie and explained energy quantization by the well known fact that differential operators of the kind appearing in his equation had a discrete spectrum however schr dinger himself initially did not understand the fundamental probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics as he thought that the amplitude squared wavefunction of an electron must be interpreted as the charge density of an object smeared out over an extended possibly infinite volume of space it was max born who introduced the probabilistic interpretation of the amplitude squared wave function as the probability distribution of the position of a pointlike object with hindsight schr dinger s wave function can be seen to be closely related to the classical hamilton jacobi equation werner heisenberg s matrix mechanics formulation introduced contemporaneously to schr dinger s wave mechanics and based on algebras of infinite matrices was certainly very radical in light of the mathematics of classical physics in fact at the time linear algebra was not generally known to physicists in its present form the reconciliation of the two approaches is generally associated to paul dirac who wrote a lucid account in his one nine three zero classic principles of quantum mechanics in it he introduced the bra ket notation together with an abstract formulation in terms of the hilbert space used in functional analysis and showed that sch dinger s and heisenberg s approaches were two different representations of the same theory dirac s method is now called canonical quantization the first complete mathematical formulation of this approach is generally credited to john von neumann s one nine three two book mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics although hermann weyl had already referred to hilbert spaces which he called unitary spaces in his one nine two seven classic book it was developed in parallel with a new approach to the mathematical spectral theory based on linear operators rather than the quadratic forms that were david hilbert s approach a generation earlier though theories of quantum mechanics continue to evolve to this day there is a basic framework for the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics which underlies most approaches and can be traced back to the mathematical work of john von neumann in other words discussions about interpretation of the theory and extensions to it are now mostly conducted on the basis of shared assumptions about the mathematical foundations later developments the application of the new quantum theory to electromagnetism resulted in quantum field theory which was developed starting around one nine three zero quantum field theory has driven the development of more sophisticated formulations of quantum mechanics of which the one presented here is a simple special case in fact the difficulties involved in implementing any of the following formulations cannot be said yet to have been solved in a satisfactory fashion except for ordinary quantum mechanics feynman path integrals axiomatic algebraic and constructive quantum field theory geometric quantization quantum field theory in curved spacetime c algebra formalism on a different front von neumann originally dispatched quantum measurement with his infamous postulate on the collapse of the wavefunction raising a host of philosophical problems over the intervening seven zero years the problem of measurement became an active research area and itself spawned some new formulations of quantum mechanics relative state many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics decoherence consistent histories formulation of quantum mechanics quantum logic formulation of quantum mechanics a related topic is the relationship to classical mechanics any new physical theory is supposed to reduce to successful old theories in some approximation for quantum mechanics this translates into the need to study the so called classical limit of quantum mechanics also as bohr emphasized human cognitive abilities and language are inextricably linked to the classical realm and so classical descriptions are intuitively more accessible than quantum ones in particular quantization namely the construction of a quantum theory whose classical limit is a given and known classical theory becomes an important area of quantum physics in itself finally some of the originators of quantum theory notably einstein and schr dinger were unhappy with what they thought were the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics in particular einstein took the position that quantum mechanics must be incomplete which motivated research into so called hidden variable theories the issue of hidden variables has become in part an experimental issue with the help of quantum optics de broglie bohm bell pilot wave formulation of quantum mechanics bell s inequalities kochen specker theorem mathematical structure of quantum mechanics a physical system is generally described by three basic ingredients states observables and dynamics or law of time evolution or more generally a group of physical symmetries a classical description can be given in a fairly direct way by a phase space model of mechanics states are points in a symplectic phase space observables are real valued functions on it time evolution is given by a one parameter group of symplectic transformations of the phase space and physical symmetries are realized by symplectic transformations a quantum description consists of a hilbert space of states observables are self adjoint operators on the space of states time evolution is given by a one parameter group of unitary transformations on the hilbert space of states and physical symmetries are realized by unitary transformations postulates of quantum mechanics the following summary of the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics can be partly traced back to von neumann s postulates each physical system is associated with a separable complex hilbert space h with inner product langle phi mid psi rangle rays one dimensional subspaces in h are associated with states of the system in other words physical states can be identified with equivalence classes of vectors of length one in h where two vectors represent the same state if they differ only by a phase factor separability is a mathematically convenient hypothesis with the physical interpretation that countably many observations are enough to uniquely determine the state the hilbert space of a composite system is the hilbert space tensor product of the state spaces associated with the component systems for a non relativistic system consisting of a finite number of distinguishable particles the component systems are the individual particles physical symmetries act on the hilbert space of quantum states unitarily or antiunitarily supersymmetry is another matter entirely physical observables are represented by densely defined self adjoint operators on h the expected value in the sense of probability theory of the observable a for the system in state represented by the unit vector left psi right rangle in h is langle psi mid a mid psi rangle by spectral theory we can associate a probability distribution to the values of a in any state we can also show that the possible values of the observable a in any state must belong to the spectrum of a in the special case a has discrete spectrum the possible values of a in any state are its eigenvalues more generally a state can be represented by a so called density operator which is a trace class nonnegative self adjoint operator rho normalized to be of trace one the expected value of a in the state rho is operatorname a rho if rho psi is the orthogonal projector onto the one dimensional subspace of h spanned by left psi right rangle then operatorname a rho psi left langle psi mid a mid psi right rangle density operators are those that are in the closure of the convex hull of the one dimensional orthogonal projectors conversely one dimensional orthogonal projectors are extreme points of the set of density operators physicists also call one dimensional orthogonal projectors pure states and other density operators mixed states one can in this formalism state heisenberg s uncertainty principle and prove it as a theorem although the exact historical sequence of events concerning who derived what and under which framework is the subject of historical investigations outside the scope of this article superselection sectors the correspondence between states and rays needs to be refined somewhat to take into account so called superselection sectors states in different superselection sectors cannot influence each other and the relative phases between them are unobservable pictures of dynamics in the so called schr dinger picture of quantum mechanics the dynamics is given as follows the time evolution of the state is given by a differentiable function from the real numbers r representing instants of time to the hilbert space of system states this map is characterized by a differential equation as follows if left psi left t right right rangle denotes the state of the system at any one time t the following schr dinger equation holds i hbar frac left psi t right rangle h left psi t right rangle where h is a densely defined self adjoint operator called the system hamiltonian i is the imaginary unit and hbar is the reduced planck constant as an observable h corresponds to the total energy of the system alternatively by stone s theorem one can state that there is a continuous one parameter unitary group u t h h such that left psi t s right rangle u t left psi s right rangle for all times s t the existence of a self adjoint hamiltonian h such that u t e is a consequence of stone s theorem on one parameter unitary groups the heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics focuses on observables and instead of considering states as varying in time it regards the states as fixed and the observables as changing to go from the schr dinger to the heisenberg picture one needs to define time independent states and time dependent operators thus left psi right rangle left psi zero right rangle a t u t au t quad it is then easily checked that the expected values of all observables are the same in both pictures langle psi mid a t mid psi rangle langle psi t mid a mid psi t rangle and that the time dependent heisenberg operators satisfy i hbara t a t h this assumes a is not time dependent in the schr dinger picture the so called dirac picture or interaction picture has time dependent states and observables evolving with respect to different hamiltonians this picture is most useful when the evolution of the states can be solved exactly confining any complications to the evolution of the operators for this reason the hamiltonian for states is called free hamiltonian and the hamiltonian for observables is called interaction hamiltonian in symbols i hbar frac left psi t right rangle operatorname left psi t right rangle i hbara t a t h the interaction picture does not always exist though in interacting quantum field theories haag s theorem states that the interaction picture does not exist this is because the hamiltonian cannot be split into a free and an interacting part within a superselection sector the heisenberg picture is the closest to classical mechanics but the schr dinger picture is considered easiest to understand by most people to judge from pedagogical accounts of quantum mechanics the dirac picture is the one used in perturbation theory and is specially associated to quantum field theory similar equations can be written for any one parameter unitary group of symmetries of the physical system time would be replaced by a suitable coordinate parameterizing the unitary group for instance a rotation angle or a translation distance and the hamiltonian would be replaced by the conserved quantity associated to the symmetry for instance angular or linear momentum representations the original form of the schr dinger equation depends on choosing a particular representation of heisenberg s canonical commutation relations the stone von neumann theorem states all irreducible representations of the finite dimensional heisenberg commutation relations are unitarily equivalent this is related to quantization and the correspondence between classical and quantum mechanics and is therefore not strictly part of the general mathematical framework the quantum harmonic oscillator is an exactly solvable system where the possibility of choosing among more than one representation can be seen in all its glory there apart from the schr dinger position or momentum representation one encounters the fock number representation and the bargmann segal phase space or coherent state representation all three are unitarily equivalent time as an operator the framework presented so far singles out time as the parameter that everything depends on it is possible to formulate mechanics in such a way that time becomes itself an observable associated to a self adjoint operator at the classical level it is possible to arbitrarily parameterize the trajectories of particles in terms of an unphysical parameter s and in that case the time t becomes an additional generalized coordinate of the physical system at the quantum level translations in s would be generated by a hamiltonian h e where e is the energy operator and h is the ordinary hamiltonian however since s is an unphysical parameter physical states must be left invariant by s evolution and so the physical state space is the kernel of h e this requires the use of a rigged hilbert space and a renormalization of the norm this is related to quantization of constrained systems and quantization of gauge theories the problem of measurement the picture given in the preceding paragraphs is sufficient for description of a completely isolated system however it fails to account for one of the main differences between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics that is the effects of measurement wavefunction collapse when von neumann proposed his mathematical postulate for quantum mechanics he included the following measurement postulate carrying out a measurement of an observable a with discrete spectrum on a system in the state represented by left psi right rangle will cause the system state to collapse into an eigenstate i e eigenvector left psi a right rangle of the operator the observed value corresponds to the eigenvalue a of the eigenstate a left psi a right rangle a left psi a right rangle mathematically the collapse corresponds to orthogonal projection of left psi right rangle onto the eigenspace of a corresponding to the observed value a von neumann s postulate regarding the effects of measurement has always been a source of confusion and speculation fortunately there is a general mathematical theory of such irreversible operations see quantum operation and various physical interpretations of the mathematics the relative state interpretation an alternative interpretation of measurement is everett s relative state interpretation which was later dubbed many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics list of mathematical tools part of the folklore of the subject concerns the mathematical physics textbook courant hilbert put together by richard courant from david hilbert s g ttingen university courses the story is told by mathematicians that physicists had dismissed the material as not interesting in the current research areas until the advent of schr dinger s equation at that point it was realised that the mathematics of the new quantum mechanics was already laid out in it it is also said that heisenberg had consulted hilbert about his matrix mechanics and hilbert observed that his own experience with infinite dimensional matrices had derived from differential equations advice which heisenberg ignored missing the opportunity to unify the theory as weyl and dirac did a few years later whatever the basis of the anecdotes the mathematics of theory was conventional at the time where the physics was radically new the main tools include linear algebra complex numbers eigenvectors eigenvalues functional analysis hilbert spaces linear operators spectral theory differential equations partial differential equations separation of variables ordinary differential equations sturm liouville theory

photoshop graphical computer applications with a multiple document interface mdi are those whose windows all reside under a single parent window usually with the exception of modal windows as opposed to all windows being separate from each other single document interface the initialism mdi is usually not expanded in the usability community there has been much debate over which interface type is preferable generally sdi is seen as more useful in cases where users work with more than one application companies have used both interfaces with mixed responses for example microsoft has changed its office applications from sdi to mdi mode and then back to sdi although the degree of implemenation varies from one component to another the disadvantage of mdi usually cited is the lack of information about the currently opened windows in order to view a list of windows open in mdi applications the user typically has to select a specific menu window list or something similar if this option is available at all with an sdi application the window manager s task bar or task manager displays the currently opened windows in recent years applications have increasingly added task bars and tabs to show the currently opened windows in an mdi application which has made this criticism somewhat obsolete some people use a different name for this interface tabbed document interface tdi when tabs are used to manage windows individual ones can usually not be resized nearly all graphical user interface toolkits to date provide at least one solution for designing mdis gtk lacks any standardized support for mdi the java gui toolkit swing for instance provides the class which serves as a container for individual frames class compared to floating windows advantages many child windows do not fill up the os task management interface as they are hierarchically organised users simply switch applications with mdi and also tdi a single menu bar and or toolbar is shared between all child windows reducing clutter and increasing efficient use of screenspace all child windows for an application can be hidden shown minimized maximized as a whole without an mdi frame window floating toolbars from one application can clutter the workspace of other applications potentially confusing users with the jumble of interfaces features such as tile and cascade can be implemented for the child windows disadvantages cannot be used succesfully on desktops using multiple monitors mdi can make it more difficult to work with several applications at once by restricting the ways in which windows from multiple applications can be arranged together the shared menu changes which may cause confusion to some users mdi child windows behave differently from those in single document interface applications requiring users to learn two subtly different windowing concepts similarly the mdi parent window behaves like the desktop in many respects but has enough differences to confuse some users many window managers have built in support for manipulating groups of separate windows which is typically more flexible than mdi in that windows can be grouped and ungrouped arbitrarily this arguably makes mdi redundant by providing a better solution to the same problem application examples internet explorer six this is a typical sdi application visual studio six development environment this is a

archaeological artefact types lithics stone age yarmulke and menorah from the harry s truman collection the menorah hebrew one of judaism s oldest symbols is a seven branched candelabrum or oil lamp ancient use a menorah beaten from a single piece of gold was used in the tabernacle the portable sanctuary used by the jews and later in its successor the temple in jerusalem lamps burning olive oil were located at the end of each branch since the destruction of the temple the seven branched menorah has had no formal role in jewish worship because of the sanctity of the temple and its appointments some authorities forbid the manufacture of menorah resembling the one used there modern use stylized hanukkah menorah hanukiah circa one nine five zero by the israeli sculptor maurice ascalon many synagogues display either a menorah or an artistic representation a menorah in addition synagogues feature a continually lit lamp in front of the ark where the torah scroll is kept called the ner tamid this lamp represents the continually lit menorah used in temple times a menorah appears in the coat of arms of the state of israel the term menorah is also used for the lamp holder with spaces for nine candles or oil lamps that are lit during the eight day holiday of hanukkah hanukkah celebrates the rededication of the temple after the successful jewish revolt against the seleucid monarchy according to the talmud the victorious jews found only enough ritually pure olive oil to light the menorah for one day but the supply miraculously lasted eight days until a new supply could be obtained the menorah used during hanukkah is also called a hanukkiah one of the spaces in the hanukkiah is raised above the others and is used for an auxiliary light the shamash which guards against secular use of the other candles or oil lamps and is also used to light them each night an additional light is kindled one on the first night two on the second night and so on until on the eighth night of hanukkah all eight lights plus the shamash are lit hanukiah branched candelabrum with nine candle holders over the gate into one of houses on kazimierz in krak w a coin issued by mattathias antigonus c four zero bce origin the torah states that god revealed the design for the menorah to moses a plant that grows in israel called the moriah typically has seven branches and resembles a menorah leading to the theory that it provided the inspiration for its design according to some readings maimonides stated that the menorah in the temple had straight branches not rounded as is often depicted see this article for a discussion of this issue jewish depictions of the menorah dating back to temple times along with the depiction on the arch of titus showing the romans taking the looted menorah to rome after the temple s destruction contradict this claim an alternative theory to the origin of the design of the menorah is based on what is known about ancient hebrew cosmology according to this theory the seven branches represent the seven heavenly bodies known at the time namely the sun and the moon as well as mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn the jewish historian josephus alludes to this in the third book of his antiquities of the jews in it he identifies what he interprets as egyptian and grecian pagan influences on the design of the tabernacle and its contents he writes for if any one do without prejudice and with judgment look upon these things he will find that they were every one made in way of imitation and representation of the universe and as to the seven lamps upon the candlesticks they referred to the course of the planets of which that is the number fate depiction of the menorah on the arch of titus the fate of the menorah used in the second temple is uncertain a depiction of it is preserved on the arch of titus that still stands today in rome the menorah is said to have remained in rome until its sack by the vandals in ad

right mouse button moving the mouse briefly to the left then releasing the button the first mouse gesture the drag was introduced by apple to replace a dedicated move button on mice shipped with its

tama monorail japan kl monorail malaysia a monorail is a transit system resembling a metro or railroad with a track consisting of a single rail guideway as opposed to the traditional track with two parallel rails there are two types of monorails straddle beam and suspended the term monorail or industrial monorail is also used to describe any number of systems in which a chair or carrier is suspended from an overhead rail structure for the limited transportation of goods or workers background gyroscopically balanced monorail one nine zero seven by brennan and scherl attempts at creating unconventional railways have been made since the latter part of the one nine th century usually these have been claimed to be more efficient faster or cheaper to construct than conventional railways several attempts have been made to create a system in which a double flanged steel wheel operates on a single rail similar to the railroad type of rail the wuppertal monorail described below is the only surviving monorail of this type monorails have both benefited and suffered from their novelty and concept of modernity when the walt disney company placed a monorail in their disneyland theme park in one nine five five it exposed large numbers of visitors to the transportation form in a credible though miniature transit setting at the same time however the disneyland monorail and others built at other disney properties and amusement locations have tended to identify monorails with amusements rather than practical transportation the popular press in the u s in mid two zero th century often featured monorail ideas in a transportation of the future context but this same press also displayed images of personal rocket backpacks and popular space travel creating interest but also confusion as to which ideas were fads and which might become reality types and technical aspects modern monorails depend on a large solid beam as the vehicles running surface there are a number of competing designs divided into two broad classes straddle beam and suspended monorails the most common type of monorail in use today is the straddle beam monorail in which the train straddles a reinforced concrete beam in the range of two to three feet zero six zero nine m wide a rubber tired carriage contacts the beam on the top and both sides for traction and to stabilize the vehicle the straddle beam style was popularized by the german company alweg there is also a form of suspended monorail developed by the french company safege in which the train cars are suspended beneath the wheel carriage in this design the carriage wheels ride inside the single beam power monorails today are powered by electric motors fed by dual third rails contact wires or electrified channels attached to or enclosed in their guidance beams switching switching has been a perennial issue with monorail systems since simple switching mechanisms associated with other systems are usually not feasible some early monorail systems notably the suspended monorail of wuppertal germany dating from one nine zero one and still in operation have a design that makes it difficult to switch from one line to another some other monorail systems avoid switching as much as possible by operating in a continuous loop or between two fixed stations as in seattle washington current operating monorails are capable of more efficient switching than in the past in the case of suspended monorails switching may be accomplished by moving flanges inside the beamway to shift trains to one line or another straddle beam monorails require that the beam structure itself be moved to accomplish switching which originally was an almost prohibitively ponderous procedure now however the most common way of achieving this is to place a moving apparatus on top of a sturdy platform capable of bearing the weight of vehicles beams and its own mechanism mulitiple segmented beams move into place on rollers to smoothly align one beam with another to send the train in its desired direction some of these beam turnouts are quite elaborate capable of switching between several beams or even simulating a railroad double crossover in cases where it must be possible to move a monorail train from one beam to any of a number of other beams as in storage or repair shops a traveling beam not unlike a railroad transfer table may be employed a single beam at least long enough to carry a single monorail vehicle is aligned at an entry beam to be mounted by the monorail cars the entire beam then rolls with the vehicle to align with the desired storage beam systems similar in appearance the term monorail is often applied by members of the public to any modern elevated railway particularly automated ones such as the docklands light railway vancouver skytrain and the jfk airtrain but this usage is erroneous these systems use the same twin rails and electric third rail as most underground metros and some main line railways advantages and disadvantages sydney monorail advantages the primary advantage of monorails over conventional rail systems is that they require minimal space both horizontally and vertically the width required is determined by the monorail vehicle not the track and monorail systems are commonly elevated requiring only a minimal footprint for support pillars due to a smaller footprint they are seen as more attractive than conventional elevated rail lines and visually block only a minimal amount of sky they are quieter as modern monorails use rubber wheels on a concrete track though some non monorail subway systems like certain lines of the paris metro and all of the montreal metro use the same technique and are equally quiet monorails are capable of climbing descending and turning faster than most conventional rail systems unlike conventional rail systems straddle monorails wrap around their track and are thus not physically capable of derailing unless the track itself suffers a catastrophic failure the disneyland monorail disadvantages a monorail switch by its very design will leave one track hanging in mid air at any given time an incorrectly positioned or jammed switch could thus cause the monorail to derail and fall although the risk can be mitigated by careful design and there are no documented cases of this actually happening in an emergency passengers cannot immediately exit because the monorail vehicle is high above ground and not all systems have emergency walkways the passengers must sometimes wait until a fire engine or a cherry picker comes to the rescue newer monorail systems resolve this by building emergency walkways alongside the entire track partial list of monorail systems monorail systems have been built in many countries around the world many of them on elevated tracks through crowded areas that would otherwise require the construction of expensive underground lines or have the disadvantages of surface

brotherhood was founded in egypt in one nine two eight muslim brotherhoods have since been founded in other countries including syria palestine and jordan egypt for details and sources see the main history of the muslim brotherhood in egypt article hassan al banna founded the muslim brotherhood in march one nine two eight along with six workers of the suez canal company the newly founded group was modeled after the freemasons secret society an organization that captured al banna s admiration hence the motto of the brotherhood the secrecy of the organization and the publicity of the da wa social work it was both a religious and a political and social movement al banna called for the return to an original islam and followed thinkers like muhammad abduh and rashid rida according to him the contemporary islam had lost its social dominance because most muslims had been corrupted by western influences the qu ran and the sunnah were seen as laws passed down by god that should be applied to all parts of life including the organization of the government and the handling of everyday problems the brotherhood also saw itself as a political and social revolutionary movement al bana strived to be a populist the muslim brotherhood wanted to protect the workers against the tyranny of foreign and monopolist companies it founded social institutions such as hospitals pharmacies schools etc the brotherhood also had a military wing called al gihaz al khass or the specialists these were members of the egyptian army and police officiers who carried out political assassinations and liquidation of unruly ikhwans by one nine three six it had eight zero zero members then this number increased greatly to up to two zero zero zero zero zero by one nine three eight by one nine four

syria one nine three seven and transjordan one nine four six it also recruted among the foreign students in cairo its headquarters in cairo became a center and meeting place for representative from the whole muslim world with some exceptions the brotherhood s leaders and members have demonstrated a commitment to a non violent reformist approach to islamism the brotherhood has been an illegal organization tolerated to varying degrees since one nine five four after a failed assassination attempt on president gamal abdul nasser which was carried out by some of the brotherhood s members it is still periodically subjected to mass arrests it remains egypt s most popular opposition group and continues to call for a more open and democratic political system in egypt in the two zero zero five parliamentary elections the brotherhood s candidates who stood as independents won eight eight seats two zero of the total to form the largest opposition bloc despite many violations of the electoral process including the arrest of hundreds of brotherhood members meanwhile the legal opposition parties won only one four seats this revived the debate within the egyptian political elite about whether the brotherhood should remain banned though the brotherhood formally renounces violence in egypt it provides outspoken support for hamas s armed campaign against israel s occupation of the west bank also the movement conducts massive fundraising efforts throughout the world to support various islamist groups syria for details and sources see the main history of the muslim brotherhood in syria article founded in the one nine three zero s by syrian students who had participated in the egyptian brotherhood the brotherhood in syria played a major role in the broad based resistance movement that opposed the ba th regime starting in one nine six three this conflict developed into an armed struggle that continued until one nine eight two when the rebellion was crushed by the military since then the brotherhood has ceased to be an active political force in syria in recent years it has renounced violence and adopted a reformist platform calling for the establishment of a pluralistic democratic political system however membership of the brotherhood is a capital offence in syria palestine the first group in palestine was formed in jerusalem in one nine four six with other groups springing up the same year in jaffa lod haifa nablus and tulkarm the brotherhood members fought alongside the arab armies during the one nine four eight arab israeli war which encouraged many

angry or with frown face the use of a regnal number is only for modern distinction from the first moctezuma referred to as moctezuma i the aztec chronicles called him motecuhzoma xocoyotzin while the

antecedents moctezuma ii heir of auitzotl was the ruler of the city of tenochtitlan the personality of moctezuma was more that of a scholar tlatimine than a warrior he was a priest and the head of the

still his students his general dislike of people led him to create an elaborate ritual to separate him from common people he created a special temple dedicated to the gods of the conquered towns inside the temple of huitzilopochtli he also built a monument dedicated to the tlatoani t zoc a ruler regarded as weak and inept who may have been poisoned during his reign he increased tenochtitlan s

caught when moctezuma looked into its mirror like eyes he saw unfamiliar men landing on the coast an account by hernando tezoz moc one five nine eight records a story of how moctezuma sent emissaries to find the legendary wizard and prophet huemac the legend says he predicted the arriving of quetzalcoatl one thousands years before to ask protection and be his servant so he could divert those signs three times he sent emissaries and three times huemac refused he recommended instead that moctezuma abandon all luxuries the flowers and the perfumes make penitence and eat the same food of the poor and drink only boiled water and maybe he would help him this is only a legend but it reflects the inner fears of moctezuma in the spring of one five one nine he received the first reports of aliens landing on the east coast of his empire according to aztec sources recorded by sahagun moctezuma sent an ambassador with two costumes one of tlaloc and another of quetzalcoatl each aztec god had his own attributes tlaloc had a mask that looks like it is wearing eye glasses quetzalcoatl had a mask with a beard the aztec ambassador upon meeting the spaniard hern n cort s decided that the conquistador had the attributes of quetzalcoatl and dressed him like the god then informed moctezuma about it cort s decided to march to tenochtitl n moctezuma tried to prevent his approach sending more gifts but the lure of gold was irresistible to the spaniards moctezuma also sent wizards priests and even one of his ambassadors tzihuacpopoca who pretended to be the emperor moctezuma sent yet more presents when cort s arrived near tenochtitl n the aztec account of this also compiled after the conquest by sahag n says they gave the spanish gold flags flags of quetzal feathers and gold necklaces and when they had given them this their faces were smiling they were very glad the spaniards they were delighted as if they were monkeys they picked up gold because they seated in such

moctezuma honored him with flowers from his own garden which was the greatest honor he could offer cort s ordered a halt to all human sacrifices moctezuma complied the blood of the temple was scrubbed

cort s in the axayacatl palace with all his men and three zero zero zero indian allies much speculation surrounds this subject writers like le n portilla and laurette s journ think that the aztec upper classes were aware that they had betrayed the ideals of the religion of quetzalcoatl the levels of human sacrifice among the aztecs were a result of the reforms of tlacaelel moctezuma was a scholar tlatimine and certainly knew all this moctezuma was not a coward in aztec society he would not have risen to the position of tlatoani had he not demonstrated bravery yet he acted with fear in the presence of cort s he submitted willingly to all the spaniard s requests during cort s s absence deputy governor pedro de alvarado interrupted the aztec celebration of toxcatl killing the most

revolt and the spanish seized moctezuma as a captive on july one one five two zero in an effort to assuage the raging mob moctezuma appeared on the balcony of his palace appealing to his countrymen to retreat the people were appalled by their emperor s complicity with the spanish and pelted him with rocks and darts he died a short time after the attack but there are differing accounts of precisely how he died according to father sahagun s aztec informants alvarado garrotted all the nobles he had in power cort s reported he died wounded by a stone in some history books cuautemoc was the culprit but the source is not reported in the ram rez codex by an anonymous christianized aztec he criticizes the spanish priests because instead of administering the last sacraments to moctezuma they were occupied searching for gold aftermath moctezuma was then succeeded by his brother cuitl huac who died shortly after from smallpox and was replaced by his adolescent nephew cuauht moc by the following year the aztec empire had entirely succumbed to the spanish during this time of conquest moctezuma s daughter techichpotzin became the heiress to the king s wealth with the name isabel and would

evangelists unam alumni in music theory the major scale or major mode is one of the diatonic scales it is often considered to be made up of seven notes eight if one includes the octave which is actually the first note of the next octave of the scale when the octaves are compounded as they usually are in practice as opposed to the more theoretical perception of the seven note system they are considered to be divided into two groups of four the tetrachords the pattern of steps in each tetrachord is in ascending order tone tone semitone tone the major scale has seven notes plus the inclusion of the tonic of the next scale to complete an octave in practise which in solfege are the syllables do re mi fa sol la ti and do at the piano keyboard the simplest major scale is c major see figure one it is unique in that it is the only major scale to not use sharps or flats on the musical staff and likewise only the white notes on the keyboard listen to the c major scale the c major scale when writing out major and minor scales every line and space on the stave has to be filled and no note can have more than one accidental this has the effect of forcing the key signature to feature just sharps or just flats ordinary major scales never include both the major scale is the same as the ionian mode constructing major scales analyzing scales with sharps scales and key signatures are closely linked in music it is necessary to construct a key signature consisting of a number of sharps or flats in order to know which notes a particular major scale will have an easy but time consuming way to do this would be to use the pattern of tone tone semitone etc given above if we choose to write the scale of d major we know immediately that the scale begins on a d the next note will be a tone above an e the note after that will also be a tone above however it is not simply an f as would seem obvious because the difference between an e and an f is actually a semitone look on a piano keyboard there is no black note in between them it is necessary to raise the f to become an f sharp to achieve a difference of a whole tone this could be followed to create a whole scale with all the sharps or with a different scale flats put correctly in however a more clever way of constructing scales arises from analysing patterns in the whole series of major scales starting on the scale of c major there exists no sharps or flats if you start a new scale on the five th of c major g major you will find one sharp augmenting the f starting the scale on the five th of g major a d it will be necessary to put two sharps in an f sharp and a c sharp writing this pattern out for all the scales looks like this c maj zero sharps g maj one sharp f f meaning f sharp d maj two sharps f c a maj three sharps f c g e maj four sharps f c g d b maj five sharps f c g d a f maj six sharps f c g d a e c maj seven sharps f c g d a e b in this table it can be seen that for each new scale starting on the fifth of the previous scale it is necessary to add a new sharp the order of sharps which need to be added follows f c g d a e b this pattern of the sharps can be easily remembered through the use of the mnemonic f c g d a e b fat cats go dancing after each breakfast looking closer the last accidental added matches the tonic first note of the scale two fifths before it in this table two lines up a useful rule for use in recognising major scales with sharps is that the tonic is also always one note above the last sharp analysing major scales with flats a similar table can be constructed for major scales with flats in them in this case each new scale starts on the five th below the previous one c maj zero flats f maj one flat bb meaning b flat bb maj two flats bb eb eb maj three flats bb eb ab ab maj four flats bb eb ab db db maj five flats bb eb ab db gb gb maj six flats bb eb ab db gb cb cb maj seven flats bb eb ab db gb cb fb here a similar pattern can be recognised each new scale keeps all the flats of the previous scale but adds a new one following the sequence bb eb ab db gb cb fb interestingly this is the direct inverse of the pattern of sharps given above luckily the mnemonic can now be reversed to form the sentence b e a d g c f battle ends and down goes charles father again there is a similar but reversed relationship between tonics and accidentals the tonic matches the second to last flat added on the circle of fifths the information gathered from analysing scales can be used in constructing the circle of fifths image fifths png this is a useful way of finding key signatures of major scales starting clockwise from the top c each new letter represents a new scale a fifth above the one before it this means that each new scale clockwise requires an extra sharp to be added to its key signature the exact sharps to be added are found by reading off the letters starting from the f to the left of the c for example if we needed to know how many and which sharps a scale of e major requires we note that e is at position four it requires four sharps these sharps are reading off from f f c g d if you were faced with a major scale with a key signature of five sharps you would count off five from the top to arrive at b it is the scale of b major image b maj png fig two the b major scale similarly key signatures with flats can be created each new letter starting from f represents a new scale and the position of the letter indicates how many flats it has the actual flats are read anticlockwise from the bb on position two bb is on position two so it has two flats bb and eb note names each of the eight notes in a major scale has a name one st note tonic two nd note supertonic three rd note mediant four th note subdominant five th note dominant six th note submediant seven th note leading note eight th note tonic harmonic properties the major scale may predominate because of its unique harmonic properties it allows major or minor chords both stable and consonant on every scale degree but the seventh a diminished fifth in the seventh chord built on the fifth degree the dominant motion by a minor second from the leading tone to the tonic root motion by fifths the strongest root motion from nearly every degree in either direction the exceptions being up a fifth from the seventh degree down a fifth

films and television programs crichton describes his genre as techno thriller which is usually the marriage of action and technical details many of his novels have medical or scientific underpinnings reflecting his medical training and science background crichton directed the film coma adapted from a robin cook novel and there are other similarities in terms of genre and the fact that both cook and crichton are physicians are of similar age and write about similar subjects biography john michael crichton was born on october two three one nine four two in chicago illinois to john henderson crichton and zula miller crichton and raised in roslyn long island new york he attended harvard university where he graduated summa cum laude in anthropology he went on to teach physical anthropology at the university of cambridge in england later returning to massachusetts to gain an m d degree from harvard medical school crichton has admitted to once plagiarizing a work by george orwell and submitting it as his own the paper was received by his professor with a mark of b crichton has stated that the plagiarism was not intended to defraud the school but rather as an experiment crichton believed that the professor in question had been intentionally giving him abnormally low marks and so as an experiment crichton informed another professor of his idea and submitted orwell s paper as his own crichton admitted to plagiarizing when he was on the stand in the course of a lawsuit trying to defend the authenticity of twister a movie which one individual claimed was based on their story entitled catch the wind while in medical school he wrote novels under the pen names john lange and jeffrey hudson under which pseudonym a case of need won the one nine six nine edgar award he also co authored dealing with his younger brother douglas crichton under a shared pen name michael douglas the back cover of that book contains a picture of michael and douglas at a very young age taken by their mother his two pen names were both created to reflect his above average height according to his own words he was about two zero six cm six nine tall in one nine nine seven see lange means tall one in dutch and sir jeffrey hudson was a famous seventeenth century dwarf in queen henrietta maria s court crichton has two sisters kimberly and catherine and a brother douglas he is married to sherri alexander and has a daughter taylor with ex wife anne marie martin scientific concepts crichton has been introducing breakthroughs in science and technologies with his books many of the ideas he used were novel to the average person despite having quite a solid scientific base before jurassic park robert t bakker s theory of warm blooded and athlete type dinosaurs was unimaginable to ordinary people who were accustomed to seeing stop motion clay dinosaurs crawling sluggishly over the volcanic prehistorical terrains however crichton s version of highly intelligent man eating dinosaurs was also criticized by scientists the scientific scheme is not completely outrageous unless one looks too closely although they are dinosaurs they could have been any death dealing automata substitute hostile extraterrestrials lunatic nazis or predatory androids and it would have been the same film with a different title aliens raiders of the lost ark or terminator two judgment day henry gee jaws with claws nature three six three six eight one one nine nine three literary techniques from time to time crichton has recycled a well known story s structure for his own story for example the andromeda strain was influenced by h g wells the war of the worlds however rather than reusing the early twentieth century plot devices crichton introduced the idea of an imaginary microscopic pathogen s evolution of virulence with his own story most of his stories tend to be somewhat open ended including jurassic park sphere and prey his work is consistently anti science in that his plots invariably portray scientific advancements going awry often with worst case scenarios seldom if ever does crichton portray scientific achievement as positive the use of author surrogate has been a feature of crichton s writings since the beginning of his career in a case of need one of his pseudonym whodunit stories crichton used first person narrative to portray the hero a bostonian

created to be the author surrogate then crichton gave that character three pages to justify his illegal practice some of crichton s fiction uses a literary technique called false document for example eaters of the dead is a fabricated recreation of the old english epic beowulf in the form of a scholastic translation of ahmad ibn fadlan s tenth century manuscript other novels such as the andromeda strain and jurassic park incorporate fictionalized scientific documents in the form of diagrams computer output dna sequences footnotes and bibliography in the terminal man crichton created a dialog between two computer programs good natured saint george and evil minded martha variations on eliza in the end the charlie brown like saint george shouts go to hell i will kill you at the provocative martha foreshadowing a killing spree conducted by the ill fated hero an innocent epileptic implanted with an experimental computerized device to control his seizures sphere contains a dialog in which a panicked scientist in an underwater lab tries to talk the omnipotent but innocent extraterrestrial life out of manifesting beautiful aquatic creatures that are harmful to human beings a common criticism of crichton s novels is that they are generally based on the conceit of a false revolution while the novels describe potentially world changing concepts such as alien plagues cloned dinosaurs and time travel the books always end with the threat destroyed or the scientific breakthrough lost in other words the events described in the novels might as well never have happened in the context of their fictional universes this allows crichton to avoid having to describe how for example time travel or cloning of extinct animals would change society fiction one nine six six odds on as

two zero zero three he gave a controversial lecture at caltech entitled aliens cause global warming in which he expressed his views of the dangers of consensus science and junk science especially with regard to popular but disputed theories such as nuclear winter the dangers of second hand smoke and the global warming controversy crichton has been critical of widespread belief of ets and ufos citing the fact that there is no conclusive proof of their existence crichton has commented that belief without a factual basis is more akin to faith faith alone is not a proper foundation for scientific belief environmentalism as a religion in a related and equally controversial speech given to the commonwealth club called environmentalism as a religion crichton describes what he sees as similarities between the structure of various religious views particularly judeo christian dogma and the beliefs of many modern urban atheists who he asserts have romantic ideas about nature and our past who he thinks believe in the initial paradise the human sins and the judgement day he also articulates his belief that it is the tendency of modern environmentalists to cling stubbornly to elements of their faith in spite of scientific evidence to the contrary crichton cites what he contends are misconceptions about ddt second hand smoke and global warming as examples however these examples are heavily disputed in the scientific community widespread speculation in the media in a speech entitled why speculate delivered in two zero zero two to the international leadership forum crichton took the media to task for engaging in what he saw as pointless speculation rather than the delivery of facts as an example he pointed to a front page article of the march six new york times that speculated about the possible effects of u s president george w bush s decision to impose tariffs on imported steel crichton also singled out susan faludi s book backlash for criticism saying that it presented hundreds of pages of quasi statistical assertions based on a premise that was never demonstrated and that was almost certainly false he referred to what he calls the murray gell mann amnesia effect to describe the public s tendency to discount one story in a newspaper they may know to be false because of their knowledge of the subject but believe the same paper on subjects with which they are unfamiliar crichton used the latin expression falsus in uno falsus in omnibus which he translated as untruthful in one part untruthful in all to describe what he thought a more appropriate reaction should be the speech also made several references to crichton s by now familiar skepticism of environmentalists assertions about the possible future ramifications of human activity on earth s environment the role of science in environmental policy making in september two zero zero five crichton testified at a congressional hearing on climate change having been called by

the urban heat island effect and satellite vs ground based measurements of earth s warming i will spare the reader additional details on the positive side crichton does emphasize the little appreciated fact that while most of the world has been warming the past few decades most of antarctica has seen a cooling trend the antarctic ice sheet is actually expected in increase in mass over the next one zero zero years due to increased precipitation according to the ipcc although recent findings by nasa call this result into question additionally crichton correctly points out that there

wedge tomb in the burren area of ireland a megalith is a large stone which has been used to construct a structure or monument either alone or with other stones megalithic means made of such stones but uses an interlocking system without the use of mortar or cement the word megalith comes from the ancient greek megas meaning large and lithos meaning stone distribution of megaliths the term can be used to describe buildings erected by people from many parts of the world living in many different periods in the early two zero th century some scholars believed that all megaliths belonged to one

third scale degree is an interval of a minor third above the tonic while some definitions of minor scale encompass modes with the minor third such as dorian mode most musicians use the term to refer to the natural minor harmonic minor and melodic minor scales described below also compare major and minor types of minor scales a natural minor scale has the following interval pattern whole step half step whole step whole step half step whole step whole step or tone semitone tone tone semitone tone tone if the scale is used with the corresponding key signature the natural minor scale is written with no accidentals for example in the key of a minor the natural minor scale is a b c d e f g a natural minor scale full octave ascending on a sometimes the natural minor scale is equated with the aeolian mode but a key characteristic of music in the minor mode in the common practice period of western music is the use of the leading tone a half step below the tonic music using the natural seventh degree called the subtonic sounds modal to western ears this music is commonly used in peruvian and other ethnic music and by modern western composers such as vaughan williams who prefer this sound but in music written from the one six th to one nine th centuries the chord built on the dominant fifth scale degree is always a major triad at least at cadence points consequently the seventh degree of the scale must be raised with an accidental to make this possible the next most important chord the subdominant is typically a minor triad these considerations of harmony lead to the harmonic minor scale the same as the natural minor but with a chromatically raised seventh degree for example in the key of a minor the harmonic minor scale is a b c d e f g a a harmonic minor the interval between the sixth and seventh degrees of this scale in this case f and g sharp is an augmented second while some composers notably mozart have used this interval to advantage in melodic composition other composers felt it to be an awkward leap thus for purposes of melody either the subtonic is used or the sixth scale degree is raised either way there is a whole step between these two scale degrees considered more conducive to smooth melody writing traditionally music theorists have called these two options the ascending melodic also known as heptatonia seconda set form seven three four and descending melodic minor scales a melodic minor ascending a melodic minor descending but historically composers have not been consistent about using them in ascending and descending melodies just as often composers choose one form or the other based on whether one of the two notes is part of the most recent chord the prevailing harmony another reason might be the use of the mediant chord based on the third degree of the scale which is an augmented triad if the raised seventh degree is used some composers prefer the use of the major triad and thus use the lowered seventh degree finding key signatures minor modes use the same set of key signatures as major modes whichever signature corresponds to the step pattern of the natural minor scale is considered the key signature for that minor mode the major and minor keys which share the same signature are called relative so c major is the relative major of a minor and c minor is the relative minor of e flat major the relative major is found by raising the minor tonic note by three semitones an interval of a minor third if you know that the key signature of g major has one sharp see major scales for how to find this then its relative minor e minor also has one sharp in its key signature this table illustrates the relative major key signatures for minor scales additional note it is possible to construct minor scales which do not correspond to a key signature such as d flat minor with double sharps double flats this becomes possible for example db minor key signature bb eb ab db gb cb fb bb the bb is now double flatted db natural minor db eb fb gb ab bbb cb db db melodic minor ascending descending db eb fb gb ab bb c db cb bbb ab gb fb eb db db harmonic minor db eb fb gb ab bbb c db on rare occasions short passages of music will be in an enharmonic scale in this case c sharp minor see also major and minor musical mode diatonic functionality reference gjerdingen robert o one nine nine zero a guide to the

lay down their arms and join with the haganah to form the newly established israel defense forces people were surprised at his slight build and mild demeanor the formality of the way he dressed and his old world manners and attention to detail and appearance the irgun together with the underground lehi militia also known as the stern gang were widely denounced by left wing israelis particularly ben gurion as terrorist organisations shortly after the founding of the state of israel the irgun and lehi chose to disband with begin renouncing any thought of civil war even though he would be in the political wilderness for almost thirty years sephardi political support begin s voice was not quelled and he continued to have an appeal to those who felt that they were second class citizens in israel particularly the newly arrived sephardim who had fled from arab countries and resented the dominance of the secular ashkenazi elites many of whom were atheists and even communists more sympathetic to the ussr than they were to the sephardim whom they deemed to be primitive therefore begin s anti socialist and anti elitist messages of jewish pride with his open embrace of judaism and the appeal to strength attracted them and the sephardic jews of israel became his political base that gave him their votes as a block and when he was finally elected as prime minister in one nine

begin founded the right wing political party herut freedom which eventually became the much larger likud party this was a move that countered the old revisionist party founded by his late mentor vladimir jabotinsky but which had become a weak institution nevertheless revisionist purists alleged that begin was out to steal jabotinsky s mantle and ran against him with the old party in the first elections one nine four nine herut won one eight seats while the revisionist party failed to break the threshold and disbanded shortly thereafter this provided begin with legitimacy as the leader of the revisionist stream of zionism between one nine four eight and one nine seven seven under begin it formed the main opposition to the dominant labour party in the knesset israel s parliament and was often derided by ben gurion who refused to either speak to or refer to begin by name but begin took it all in stride begin was trained as a lawyer in poland and he preferred the formal suit and tie and the dry demeanor of a legislator to the more bolshevik informality of israel s socialists he was confident that he would be vindicated with the passage of time in one nine seven three begin agreed

inheritance of his mantle became a subject of conjecture during the debate over the two zero zero five gaza withdrawal that current prime minister ariel sharon implemented opponents of the withdrawal in the likud led by finance minister benjamin netanyahu and uzi landau called it a dangerous departure from the likud platform especially after sharon ran against the same policy in two zero zero three they viewed themselves as the natural successors of menachem begin who in one nine seven five congratulated the first jewish settler group when they founded elon moreh sharon s supporters pointed to begin s exchange of the sinai with egypt that ended in one nine eight two as an historical justification for the painful step when sharon left the likud in november two zero zero five to form kadima an internal purge of the party of symbols of the departed leader was performed in many party branches photographs of sharon were ripped from the walls and with the absence of a clear successor they were replaced almost always with photos or images of begin those who remain faithful to the likud after sharon left point to begin s long struggle until one nine seven seven in the political opposition and the fact that he never abandoned his party even when they were reduced to a minuscule eight seats in the knesset in one nine five two evidently sharon supporters have abandoned the comparisons of him with begin and instead he is being put in the same boat as such stately icons as charles de gaulle or even begin s nemesis ben gurion the battle over who really has

revolutionaries the phrase mergers and acquisitions or m poison pill see delaware corporations financing m merger or merger of equals is often financed by an all stock deal a stock swap an all stock deal occurs when all of the owners of stocks of either company get the same amount of stock in the new combined company the term demerger is sometimes used to indicate the effective opposite of a merger where one company splits into two the second often being a separately listed stock company if the parent was a stock company acquisition an acquisition of un equals one large buying one small can involve a cash and debt combination or just cash or a combination of cash and stock of the purchasing entity or just stock the sears kmart acquisition is an example of a cash deal in addition the acquisition can take the form of a purchase of the stock or other equity interests of the target entity or the acquisition of all or substantially of its assets high yield in some cases a company may acquire another company by issuing high yield debt high interest yield junk rated bonds to raise funds often referred to as a leveraged buyout the reason the debt carry a high yield is the risk involved the owner can not or does not want to risk his own money in the deal but third party companies are willing to finance the deal for a high cost of capital a high interest yield the combined company will be the borrower of the high yield debt and it will be on its balance sheet this may result in the combined company having a low shareholders equity to loan capital ratio equity ratio

completed mergers in some cases terming the combination a merger rather than an acquisition is done purely for political or marketing reasons classifications of mergers horizontal mergers take place where the two merging companies produce similar product in the same industry vertical mergers occur when two firms each working at different stages in the production of the same good combine conglomerate mergers take place when the two firms operate in different industries a unique type of merger called a reverse merger is used as a way of going public without the expense and time required by an ipo issues the occurrence of a merger often raises concerns in anti trust circles devices such as the herfindahl index can analyze the impact of a merger on a market and what if any action could prevent it regulatory bodies such as the european commission and the united states department of justice may investigate anti trust cases for monopolies dangers and have the power to block mergers the completion of a merger does not ensure the success of the resulting organization indeed many in some industries the majority mergers result in a net loss of value due to problems correcting problems caused by incompatibility whether of technology equipment or corporate culture diverts resources away from new investment and these problems may be exacerbated by inadequate research or by concealment of losses or liabilities at one of the partners overlapping subsidiaries or redundant staff may be allowed to continue creating inefficiency and conversely the new management may cut too many operations or personnel losing expertise and disrupting employee culture these problems are similar to those encountered in takeovers for the merger to not be considered a failure it must increase shareholder value faster than if the companies were separate or prevent the deterioration of shareholder value more than if the companies were separate major mergers america

three zero d d c two zero zero zero was a court case filed against microsoft corporation on may one eight one nine nine eight by the united states department of justice doj and twenty u s states joel i klein was the lead prosecutor the plaintiffs alleged that microsoft abused monopoly power in its handling of operating system sales and web browser sales the issue central to the case was whether microsoft was allowed to bundle its flagship internet explorer ie web browser software with its microsoft windows operating system bundling them together is alleged to have been responsible for microsoft s victory in the browser wars as every windows user had a copy of internet explorer it was further alleged that this unfairly restricted the market for competing web browsers such as netscape navigator that were slow to download over a modem or had to be purchased at a store underlying these disputes were questions over whether microsoft altered or manipulated its application programming interfaces apis to favor internet explorer over third party web browsers microsoft s conduct in forming restrictive licensing agreements with oem computer manufacturers and microsoft s intent in its course of conduct microsoft stated that the merging of microsoft windows and internet explorer was the result of innovation and competition and that the two were now the same product and were inextricably linked together and that consumers were now getting all the benefits of ie for free those who opposed microsoft s position countered that the browser was still a distinct and separate product which didn t need to be tied to the operating system since a separate version of internet explorer was available for mac os they also asserted that ie was not really free because its development and marketing costs may have kept the price of windows higher than it might otherwise have been the case was tried before u s district court judge thomas penfield jackson the doj was initially represented by david boies history government interest in microsoft s affairs had begun in one nine nine one with an inquiry by the federal trade commission over whether microsoft was abusing its monopoly on the pc operating system market the ftc commissioners deadlocked with a two two vote in one nine nine three and closed the investigation but the doj opened its own investigation on august two one of that year resulting in a settlement on july one five one nine nine four in which microsoft consented not to tie other microsoft products to the sale of windows but remained free to integrate additional features into the operating system in the years that followed microsoft insisted that internet explorer which first appeared in the plus pack sold separately from windows nine five was not a product but a feature which it was allowed to add to windows the doj did not agree with this definition however trial the trial started in may one nine nine eight with the us justice department and the attorneys general of twenty us states sueing microsoft for illegally thwarting competition in order to protect and extend its software monopoly later in october the us justice department also sued microsoft for violating a one nine nine four consent decree by forcing computer makers to include its internet browser as a part of the installation of windows software during the antitrust case it was revealed that microsoft had threatened pc manufacturers with revoking their license to distribute windows if they removed the internet explorer icon from the initial desktop something that netscape had requested of its licensees microsoft chairman bill gates was called evasive and nonresponsive by a source present at a session in which gates was questioned on his deposition he argued over the definitions of words such as compete jihad concerned ask and we businessweek reported early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying i don t recall so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle worse many of the technology chief s denials and pleas of ignorance have been directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e mail gates both sent and received intel vice president steven mcgeady called as a witness quoted paul maritz a senior microsoft vice president as having stated an intention to extinguish and smother rival netscape communications corporation and to cut off netscape s air supply by giving away a clone of netscape s flagship product for free the microsoft executive denied the allegations a number of videotapes were submitted as evidence by microsoft during the trial including one that demonstrated that removing internet explorer from microsoft windows caused slowdowns and malfunctions in windows in the videotaped demonstration of what microsoft vice president james allchin s stated to be a seamless segment filmed on one pc the plaintiff noticed that some icons mysteriously disappear and reappear on the pc s desktop suggesting that the effects might have been falsified allchin admitted that the blame for the tape problems lied with some of his staff they ended up filming it grabbing the wrong screen shot he said of the incident later allchin re ran the demonstration and provided a new videotape but in so doing microsoft dropped the claim that windows is slowed down when internet explorer is removed mark murray a microsoft spokesperson berated the government attorneys for nitpicking on issues like video production microsoft submitted a second inaccurate videotape into evidence later the same month as the first the issue in question was how easy or hard it was for america online users to download and install netscape navigator onto a windows pc microsoft s videotape showed the process as being quick and easy resulting in the netscape icon appearing on the user s desktop the government produced its own videotape of the same process revealing that microsoft s videotape had edited out a long and complex part of the procedure and that the netscape icon wasn t placed on the desktop requiring a user to search for it brad chase a microsoft vice president verified the government s tape and conceded that microsoft s own tape was inaccurate when the judge ordered microsoft to offer a version of windows which did not include internet explorer microsoft responded that the company would offer manufacturers a choice one version of windows that was obsolete or another that did not work properly the judge asked it seemed absolutely clear to you that i entered an order that required that you distribute a product that would not work david cole a microsoft vice president replied in plain english yes we followed that order it wasn t my place to consider the consequences of that princeton university professor edward felten presented a modified version of windows from which he claimed the internet explorer function had been removed on cross examination he was guided through a sequence of steps that produced a fully functional internet explorer window microsoft vigorously defended itself in the public arena claiming that its attempts to innovate were under attack by rival companies jealous at its success and that government litigation was merely their pawn a full page ad run in the washington post and the new york times on june two one nine nine

ask for these antitrust actions rival business firms did consumers of high technology have enjoyed falling prices expanding outputs and a breathtaking array of new products and innovations increasingly however some firms have sought to handicap their rivals races by turning to government for protection many of these cases are based on speculation about some vaguely specified consumer harm in some unspecified future and many of the proposed interventions will weaken successful u s firms and impede their competitiveness abroad judge jackson issued his findings of fact on november five one nine nine nine which stated that microsoft s dominance of the personal computer operating systems market constituted a monopoly and that microsoft had taken actions to crush threats to the monopoly including apple java netscape lotus notes real networks linux and others then on april three two zero zero zero he issued a two part ruling his conclusions of law were that microsoft had committed monopolization attempted monopolization and tying in violation of sections one and two of the sherman act and his remedy was that microsoft must be broken into two separate units one to produce the operating system and one to produce other software components some argue that the outcome of the antitrust case has served to chill venture capital investment in technical startup companies for fear that microsoft will notice the startup s niche and starve off the new company to protect microsoft s market others argue that the outcome of the case harms technological innovation due to fear of being challenged by an anti trust lawsuit appeal on september two six two zero zero zero after judge jackson issued his findings of fact microsoft appealed to the supreme court however the supreme court declined to hear the appeal and sent the case to a federal appeals court the d c circuit court of appeals unanimously overturned judge jackson s rulings against microsoft on browser tying and attempted monopolization on grounds that he gave off the record but nevertheless disclosed interviews to the news media during the case and that judge jackson having opinions about the defendant was improper judge jackson s response to this was that microsoft s conduct itself was the cause of any perceived bias microsoft executives had proved time and time again to be inaccurate misleading evasive and transparently false microsoft is a company with an institutional disdain for both the truth and for rules of law that lesser entities must respect it is also a company whose senior management is not averse to offering specious testimony to support spurious defenses to claims of its wrongdoing however the appeals court did affirm in part judge jackson s ruling on monopolization the d c circuit remanded the case for consideration of a proper remedy for drastically altered scope of liability that the court had upheld under judge colleen kollar kotelly the doj now under the administration of u s president george w bush announced on september six two zero zero one that it was no longer seeking to break up microsoft and would instead seek a lesser antitrust penalty settlement on november two two zero zero one the doj reached an agreement with microsoft to settle the case the proposed settlement required microsoft to share its application programming interfaces with third party companies and appoint a panel of three people who will have full access to microsoft s systems records and source code for five years in order to ensure compliance however the doj did not require microsoft to change any of its code nor prevent microsoft from tying other software with windows in the future on august five two zero zero two microsoft announced that it would make some concessions towards the proposed final settlement ahead of the judge s verdict on november one two zero zero two judge kollar kotelly released a judgment accepting most of the proposed doj settlement nine states and the district of columbia which had been pursuing the case together with the doj did not agree with the settlement arguing that it did not go far enough to curb microsoft s anti competitive business practices on june three zero two zero zero four the u s appeals court unanimously approved the settlement with justice department rejecting objections from massachusetts that the sanctions are inadequate the dissenting states regarded the settlement as merely a slap on the wrist some people in the computer industry agreed with dissenting states especially those who advocated open source and alternatives to microsoft many believed that free market competition can only be restored by government intervention to break up the microsoft monopoly others believe that government intervention is antithetical to free market principles maintaining that microsoft was not and is not a coercive monopoly industry pundit robert x cringely believes a breakup is not possible and that now the only way microsoft can die is by suicide andrew chin an antitrust law professor at the university of north carolina at chapel hill who assisted judge jackson in drafting the findings of fact wrote that the settlement gave microsoft a special antitrust immunity to license windows and other platform software under contractual terms that destroy freedom of competition microsoft s obligations under the settlement expire on november one two two zero zero seven criticisms of the case some critics of the antitrust proceedings against microsoft assert that they were an unjustified assault on a business that held a large market share merely by outcompeting its rivals some hold that the case against microsoft was the result of collusion between government and microsoft s competitors in an attempt to gain an unfair advantage by thwarting the free market through government coercion nobel economist milton friedman believes that the antitrust case against microsoft set a dangerous precedent that foreshadowed increasing government regulation of what was formerly an industry that was relatively free of government intrusion and that future technological progress in the industry will be impeded as a result moreover friedman says that antitrust laws do more harm than good and should not exist strict free market advocates believe that the only type of monopolies that should be dismantled are coercive monopolies and reject the claim that microsoft falls in this category jean louis gass e ceo of be inc which at the time made a competing operating system which eventually folded in the face of microsoft s dominance provided a series of criticisms against the antitrust suit these criticisms were levelled at the overemphasis on the packaging problem microsoft wasn t really making any money off the sales of internet explorer and its reason for incorporating it into the operating system was because the consumer expected to have a browser packaged with the operating system indeed beos came packaged with its web browser netpositive instead he argued microsoft s true anticompetitive clout was in the rebates it offered to oems preventing other operating systems from getting a foothold in the market the lobby group association for competitive technology act was founded in response to the case though some claim that the organization is mainly a front

the mercator projection of the world up to a latitude of eight four n and s the mercator projection is a cylindrical map projection devised by gerardus mercator in one five six nine its parallels and meridians are straight lines and the unavoidable east west stretching away from the equator is accompanied by a corresponding north south stretching so that at each location the east west scale is the same as the north south scale a mercator map can never fully show the polar areas it would be infinitely high it is a conformal map that is it preserves angles any straight line on a mercator map is a line of constant bearing that is a loxodrome or rhumb line this makes it particularly useful to navigators even though the plotted route is usually not a great circle shortest distance route in the era of sailing ships time of travel was subject to the elements hence the distance traveled was not as important as the direction taken especially since longitude was hard to determine accurately nautical charts use the mercator projection almost universally many aircrafts also use the mercator projection to plot their routes relation between vertical position on the map horizontal in the graph and latitude vertical in the graph the following equations determine the x and y coordinates of a point on a mercator map from its latitude and longitude with zero being the longitude in the center of map begin x getting arbitrarily large near the poles where plus or minus nine zero moreover as seen from the formulas for the poles y is plus or minus infinity controversy tissot s indicatrix like all map projections attempting to fit a curved surface onto a flat sheet the shape of the map is a distortion of the true layout of the earth s surface the mercator projection exaggerates the size and to a lesser extent the shape of areas far from the equator for example greenland is presented as being roughly as large as africa when in fact africa s area is approximately one three times that of greenland as shown by tissot s indicatrix although the mercator projection is still in common use for navigation critics argue that it is not suited to representing the entire world in publications and wall maps due to its distortion of land area mercator himself used the equal area sinusoidal projection to show relative areas as a result of these criticisms modern atlases no longer use the mercator projection for world maps or for areas distant from the equator preferring other cylindrical projections or forms of equal area projection the mercator projection is still commonly used for areas near the equator however the equal area gall peters projection has also been proposed as an alternative to address these concerns this presents a very different view of the world the shape rather than the size of areas is distorted areas near the equator are stretched vertically areas far from the equator are squashed a one nine eight nine resolution by seven north american geographical groups decried the use of all rectangular coordinate world maps including the gall peters projection google maps currently uses a mercator projection for its map images probably because a magnification of any small region of a mercator map will appear undistorted in shape with north at the top despite its relative scale distortions the mercator is therefore well suited to an interactive world map that can be panned and zoomed seamlessly to local maps google satellite on the other hand used a plate carr e projection until recently derivation of the projection the mercator

european history the inscription moneta nova or new money appeared on many coins issued on the european continent midas often referred to as king midas was a character in greek mythology who is mostly recognized for his ability to turn anything he touched into gold he was king of pessinus a city in phrygia in asia minor who as a child was adopted by gordias and cybele he was known for being a hedonist and an excellent rose gardener and according to the myth he had one son lityerses but in some variations of the myth he had a daughter zoe instead of a son background historically it is known that midas was king of phrygia in the eight th century bc according to legend he was the son of gordius a poor countryman who was taken by the people and made king in obedience to the command of the oracle the oracle said according to the myth that their future king should come in a wagon while the people were deliberating gordius with his wife and son came driving in his wagon into the public square other versions of the myth portray midas as a peasant who performed a good deed and became king where greed then swept him over the myth once dionysus the god of wine found his old school master and foster father silenus missing the old man had been drinking and had wandered away drunk and was found by some peasants who carried him to their king midas alternatively he passed out in midas rose garden midas recognized him and treated him hospitably entertaining him for ten days and nights with politeness while silenus entertained midas and his friends with stories and songs on the eleventh day he brought silenus back to dionysus dionysus offered midas his choice of whatever reward he wanted midas asked that whatever he might touch should be changed into gold dionysus consented though was sorry that he had not made a better choice midas rejoiced in his new power which he hastened to put to the test he touched and turned to gold an oak twig and a stone overjoyed as soon as he got home he ordered the servants to set a feast on the table then he found that his bread meat and wine turned to gold and became inedible he found that when he touched his daughter she turned into a statue as well this made him realize the bad choice he d made upset midas strove to divest himself of his power the midas touch he hated the gift he had coveted he prayed to dionysus begging to be delivered from starvation dionysus heard and consented he told midas to wash in the river pactolus he did so and when he touched the waters the power passed into the river and the river sands became changed into gold note this explained why the river pactolus was so rich in gold midas hating wealth and splendor moved to the country and became a worshipper of pan the god of the fields once pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of apollo and to challenge apollo the god of the lyre to a trial of skill tmolus the mountain god was chosen to umpire pan blew on his pipes and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower midas who happened to be present then apollo struck the strings of his lyre tmolus at once awarded the victory to apollo and all but midas agreed with the judgment he dissented and questioned the justice of the award apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer and caused them to become the ears of a donkey king midas was moritifed at this mishap but he attempted to hide his misfortune with an ample turban or headdress but his hairdresser of course knew the secret he was told not to mention it he could not keep the secret so he went out into the meadow dug a hole in the ground whispered the story into it and covered the hole up a thick bed of reeds sprang up in the meadow and began whispering the story and saying king midas has an ass s ears some of his people heard and began to gossip about it midas found out who had told and was going to kill him but decided not to apollo then came and gave him normal ears again as he had completely shown that he had changed his ways see also the tales of king midas has been told by others with some variations dryden in the wife of bath s tale by

themselves unlike misogyny a pathological antipathy towards women misandry has been little discussed or investigated the word comes from greek misos hatred andr man this term is sometimes used interchangeably with misanthropy but that is not correct usage as misanthropy refers to hatred of humanity in general androphobia is the fear of men but it is not an exact synonym of misandry within those who research and study misandry there are various schools of thought some masculists maintain that misandry has been rampant for thirty years maintaining feminist advocacy has become widespread popular culture and thus misandry has become a social pathology on the other hand some feminists believe misogyny to be a social disease but are skeptical of the current condition of misandry more popular is the view held by a large number of both feminists and masculists that the war of the sexes arising from traditional gender roles is the primary source of both misogyny and misandry forms of misandry there are many different forms of misandry in its most overt expression a misandrist will openly hate all men simply because they are men other forms of misandry may be more subtle some misandrists may simply hold all men under suspicion or may hate men who do not fall into one or more acceptable categories entire cultures may be said to be misandrist if they treat men in ways that can be seen as hurtful misandry in popular culture some hold that certain aspects of popular culture have depictions or display attitudes which could be said to show misandry such as depictions of men as being sex crazed and overbearing attitudes where women are superior to men including think better make better choices elect better candidates depictions in sitcoms and advertising of bumbling male ineptitude especially fathers descriptions where the body count as described by some as there were x fatalities including y women and children is argued to reduce the value of the male lives lost the

plates could be projected on to a suitable screen the ancestor of the modern slide projector by the one nine th century there was a thriving trade of itinerant projectionists who would travel britain with their magic lanterns and a large number of slides putting on shows in towns and villages some of the slides came with special effects by means of extra sections that could slide or rotate across

photography enabled the inexpensive creation and reproduction of slides and thereby greatly expanded the repertoire of available images slide shows would feature famous landmarks foreign lands and

released in two zero zero one and directed by david lynch project development the project was initially intended to be a two hour pilot for an abc television series with abc hoping to repeat the success of lynch s twin peaks when lynch finally gave them the finished pilot abc requested numerous cuts for the sake of time and content although lynch made the requested cuts the network was not happy with the resulting piece and declined further involvement lynch kept control of the footage he had already shot and with the help of canal plus a french distributor finished the pilot and reworked it as a film release mulholland drive premiered at the two zero zero one cannes film festival to much praise lynch was co awarded the best director prize at the festival sharing it with joel coen for the man who wasn t there it was named best picture by the new york film critics circle and even more notably was given an enthusiastic thumbs up by critic roger ebert who had previously expressed mixed feelings about lynch s work lynch was also nominated for a best directing oscar for the third time though a beautiful mind director ron howard won out nevertheless the film had little commercial success grossing just over seven million at the american box office and a further one three million globally however the film has gained cult status since its release with many interpretations floating on the internet about the film s meaning and symbolism lynch as usual for his works has not given any explanations about the film s true meaning the us and uk dvd release does contain one zero clues from the director on the inner sleeve but this has only promoted further speculation about the mysteries of the film synopsis while driving down mulholland drive in los angeles california late at night a dark haired woman played by laura elena harring has a car accident and afterwards suffers amnesia she wanders down the hill into l a and sleeps in a vacant apartment the next day betty elms played by naomi watts a young and cloyingly perky aspiring actress who has just moved to hollywood from deep river ontario moves in and finds her the dark haired woman decides to call herself rita from a movie poster advertising rita hayworth in gilda together the two of them try to piece together exactly who she is and what happened that night other strange things at first seemingly unrelated are happening as well a man tells a friend about a recurring nightmare only to have it come true a film director adam kesher played by justin theroux finds his latest project and later his life being turned upside down by shadowy mobsters who force him to hire an unknown girl named camilla to play a lead role in his new film and an incompetent hit man steals a black book the plot developments become more and more bizarre until finally the film leaves these storylines behind altogether and shifts gears entirely after a sexual encounter between betty and rita who then attend a strange and eerie performance in a mysterious midnight theatre an entirely new reality suddenly emerges as roger ebert comments characters start to fracture and recombine like flesh caught in a kaleidoscope now watts plays a failed actress diane selwyn trapped in an unhappy life her one time girlfriend camilla now played by harring has abandoned her to pursue a life of riches and glamour by marrying a successful director the very same adam kesher in anger and desperation diane hires a hit man to kill her at the end of the film the tormented diane kills herself as well interpretation and allusions lynch has maintained his refusal to comment on the film s meaning or symbolism leading to much discussion and multiple interpretations however one common interpretation is based on a freudian desire gratification wish fulfillment interpretation for references to accounts of this interpretation see classical interpretation salon com essay modern word analysis warning each contains spoilers according to freudian theory the mind consists of three parts the id the ego and the superego and the wishes and desires of the id are made real in our dreams at least to the extent that our superego denies us when awake asleep the superego represented by the woman in blue hair at the end of the movie transforms these dreams from that which is denied to that which is permissible furthermore bits and pieces of information from the waking life are taken in a disorganized manner to construct such a dream reality under the freudian interpretation the first part of the film is a dream of the real diane selwyn who in her dream has cast herself as the innocent and hopeful betty elms and reconstructed her life history and persona into something like a hollywood movie this includes her ultimate seduction by the dark allure and hollow promises of stardom by hollywood a metaphoric seduction that is turned into a physical one in her dream the second half of the film is then the bleak reality of diane s actual life a life where so many wishes and desires both personal and professional have fallen tragically short the film contains structural and conceptual similarities to other films including sunset boulevard persona vertigo and the wizard of oz david lynch s one zero clues the director and cast at cannes two zero zero one l r naomi watts david lynch

camilla notice the occurrences surrounding the man behind winkies where is aunt ruth it is perhaps worth noting the public speculation that this list is merely a joke on the part of the director given lynch s general reluctance to explain the answer to his works it is understandable why some might doubt his sudden decision to point his audience towards a concrete conclusion production notes mulholland drive is an actual road that twists its way through the hollywood hills outside of los angeles it also appeared in lynch s film lost highway as the road mr eddy takes pete dayton for a

prosthetic body lynch s longtime music composer and collaborator angelo badalamenti appears as a mobster with very exacting taste in espresso which may be a joking reference to the agent cooper s coffee obsession in twin peaks the movie features one of the final film appearances by mgm musical legend ann miller the dvd release of the film proved controversial when lynch edited it to obscure the full frontal nudity of actress laura harring allegedly at her request leading to accusations of censorship against the director and a proliferation of unaltered versions of the scene on the

but saw the vision of angels matthew two eight five as the first witness to the resurrection mary magdalene went to tell peter and john john two zero one two gaining her the epithet apostle to the apostles and again immediately returned to the sepulchre she remained there weeping at the door of the tomb according to the new testament the risen lord appeared to her but at first she knew him not when he said her name she was recalled to consciousness and cried rabboni she wanted to cling to him but he forbade her one seven jesus said to her do not cling to me for i have not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say to them i am ascending to my father and your father and to my god and your god this is the last entry in the canonical new testament regarding mary of magdala who now returned to jerusalem identification with other women of the new testament tradition as early as the three rd century identifies mary magdalene with mary of bethany and the woman sinner who anointed jesus s feet the latter person can be found in luke seven three six five zero and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at meat in the pharisee s house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment though the woman remains unnamed she is identified with mary of bethany the sister of martha and the resurrected lazarus luke one zero three eight four two and john one one zero as john one one one two says now there was a certain man sick named lazarus of bethania of the town of mary and martha her sister and mary was she that anointed the lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick the identification of mary magdalene with mary of bethany also led to her being identified with the woman who was a sinner church fathers of the three rd and four th centuries considered this sin as being unchaste catholics traditionally identify all three women which is reflected in a sermon of pope gregory i five nine one a d she whom luke calls the sinful woman whom john calls mary of bethany we believe to be the mary from whom seven devils were ejected according to mark eastern orthodox christians distinguish between mary magdalene on the one hand and mary of bethany the woman who was a sinner on the other hand protestants mostly reject all these identifications for some christians the idea developed by church fathers that mary is also the woman that jesus had rescued from being stoned to death as recounted in the pericope adulterae still holds true this is reflected in the mel gibson movie the passion of the christ as well as in martin scorsese s earlier film adaptation of nikos kazantzakis s novel the last temptation of christ scholars however believe that mary magdalene mary of bethany and the woman jesus rescued as well as the one who anointed him at simon the lepers house in the gospel of luke are all different women veneration of mary magdalene the eastern orthodox church maintains that the saint retired to ephesus with the blessed virgin and there died that her relics were transferred to constantinople in eight eight six and are there preserved gregory of tours de miraculis i xxx supports the tradition that she retired to ephesus with no mention of any connection to gaul how a cult of mary magdalene first arose in provence is not clear as a roman catholic saint mary magdalene s relics were first venerated at the abbey of v zelay in burgundy jacobus de voragine gives the official story of the translation of the relics of mary magdalene from her sepulchre in the oratory of saint maximin at aix en provence to the newly founded abbey of v zelay the abbey of vesoul in william caxton s translation that was reputed to have been undertaken in seven seven one by the founder of the abbey identified as gerard duke of burgundy medieval sourcebook the saint maximin of this legend is a figure who conflates the historical bishop maximin with the maximin accompanying mary magdalen martha and lazarus to provence basilica saint maximin la sainte baume a cult later than the legenda aurea drew pilgrims to the body of mary magdalene officially discovered september nine one two seven nine at saint maximin la sainte baume provence where they attracted such throngs of pilgrims that the earlier shrine was rebuilt as the great basilica from the mid thirteenth century one of the finest gothic churches in the south of france the competition between the cluniac benedictines of v zelay and the dominicans of saint maxime occasioned a rash of miraculous literature supporting the one or the other site jacopo de voragine compiling his legenda aurea before the competition arose characterized mary magdalen as the emblem of penitence washing the feet of jesus with her copious tears protectress of pilgrims to jerusalem daily lifting by angels at the meal hour in her fasting retreat and many other miraculous happenings in the genre of romance ending with her death in the oratory of saint maximin all disingenuously claimed to have been drawn from the histories of hegesippus and of josephus the french tradition of saint lazare of bethany is that mary her brother lazarus and maximinus one of the seventy two apostles and some companions expelled by persecutions from the holy land traversed the mediterranean in a frail boat with neither rudder nor mast and landed at the place called sainte marie de mer near arles mary magdalene came to marseille and converted the whole of provence magdalene is said to have retired to a cave on a hill by marseille la sainte baume holy cave baumo in provencal where she gave herself up to a life of penance for thirty years when the time of her death arrived she was carried by angels to aix and into the oratory of saint maximinus where she received the viaticum her body was then laid in an oratory constructed by st maximinus at villa lata afterwards called st maximin there is no earlier mention of these episodes than the notice in seven four five when the chronicler sigebert the relics were removed to v zelay through fear of the saracens there is no record of their return and a casket of relics associated with magdalene remains at vezelay in one two seven nine when charles ii king of naples erected a dominican convent at la sainte baume the shrine was marvelously found intact with an explanatory inscription stating why the relics had been hidden in one six zero zero the relics were placed in a sarcophagus commissioned by pope clement viii the head being placed in a separate reliquary the relics and free standing images were scattered and destroyed at the revolution in one eight one four the church of la sainte baume also wrecked during the revolution was restored and in one eight two two the grotto was consecrated afresh the head of the saint now lies there and has been the centre of many pilgrimages the magdalene became a symbol of repentance for the vanities of the world and mary magdalene was the patron of magdalen college oxford and magdalene college cambridge both pronounced maudlin as in weepy penitents unfortunately her name was also used for the infamous magdalen asylums in ireland where fallen women were mistreated and exploited mary magdalene at the foot of the cross easter egg tradition for centuries it has been the custom of many christians to share dyed and painted eggs particularly on easter sunday the eggs represent new life and christ bursting forth from the tomb among eastern orthodox this sharing is accompanied by the proclamation christ is risen one tradition concerning mary magdalene says that following jesus christ s death and resurrection she used her position to gain an invitation to a banquet given by emperor tiberius caesar when she met him she held a plain egg in her hand and exclaimed christ is risen caesar laughed and said that christ rising from the dead was as likely as the egg in her hand turning red while she held it before he finished speaking the egg in her hand turned a bright red and she continued proclaiming the gospel to the entire imperial house there is also a supposed tradition that the remnants of christ s heart remain inside an egg like vessel and that this vessel is the basis for the sacred heart motif in catholicism in some legends the sacred heart exists as a guarded sacred object or a metaphysical essence passed from hand to hand with mary magdalene being listed among noteworthy caretakers a group of scholars have suggested that for one early group of christians mary magdalene was a leader of the early church and maybe even the unidentified beloved disciple to whom the fourth gospel commonly called gospel of john is ascribed the most familiar of the scholars is elaine pagels ramon k jusino offers an explanation of this unorthodox view based on the textual researches of raymond e brown a biblical scholar in mary magdalene author of the fourth gospel one nine nine eight available on line ann graham brock see ref summarized this reading of the texts in two zero zero three she demonstrated that an early christian writing portrays authority as being represented in mary magdalene or in the church community structure these scholars also observe that the mary magdalene figure is consistently elevated in writings from which formal leadership roles are absent while the paul figure is more involved in a tug of war between these two opposing systems of church government scholars of the mary who appears in the nag hammadi gnostic texts have identified her with the magdalene even though she is merely given the coptic equivalent of mary however stephen j shoemaker thinks that this mary is actually the blessed virgin mary shoemaker two zero zero one that this fits in better with the notions that mary was intimate with jesus was his greatest disciple and was to be the center of jesus religion shoemaker has made a study of marian liturgies and devotion in early christianity the gospel of mary mary magdalene in a dramatic one nine th century popular image of penitence painted by ary scheffer further attestation of mary of magdala and her role among some early christians is provided by the gnostic apocryphal gospel of mary magdalene which survives in two three rd century greek fragments and a longer five th century translation into coptic in the gospel the testimony of a woman first needed to be defended all of these manuscripts were first discovered and published between one nine three eight and one nine eight three but as early as the three rd century there are patristic references to the gospel of mary these writings reveal the degree to which the gospel was despised and dismissed by the early church fathers in the fragmentary text the disciples ask questions of the risen savior a designation that dates the original no earlier than the two nd century and are answered then they grieve saying how shall we go to the gentiles and preach the gospel of the kingdom of the son of man if even he was not spared how shall we be spared and mary magdalene bids them take heart let us rather praise his greatness for he prepared us and made us into men she then delivers at peter s request a vision of the savior she has had and reports her discourse with him which shows gnostic influences her vision does not meet with universal approval but andrew answered and said to the brethren say what you think concerning what she said for i do not believe that the savior said this for certainly these teachings are of other ideas peter also opposed her in regard to these matters and asked them about the savior did he then speak secretly with a woman in preference to us and not openly are we to turn back and all listen to her did he prefer her to us dr karen king a professor of church history at harvard divinity school has observed the confrontation of mary with peter a scenario also found in the gospel of thomas pistis sophia and the gospel of the egyptians reflects some of the tensions in second century christianity peter and andrew represent orthodox positions that deny the validity of esoteric revelation and reject the authority of women to teach introduction the nag hammadi library early christian writings gospel of mary gospel of mary english syncretic text incorporating coptic and earlier greek versions further web links assertions about mary magdalene the penitent mary magdalene by francesco hayez some modern writers have come up with speculative claims that mary magdalene was the wife of jesus these writers cite non canonical and gnostic writings to support their argument sources like the gospel of philip do depict mary magdalene as being closer to jesus than any other disciple however there is no ancient document which claims she was his wife and gnosticism was generally non supportive of sexuality the closeness described in these writings depicts mary magdalene representing the gnostics as understanding jesus and his teaching while the other disciples representing the church did not mary magdalene appears with more frequency than other women in the canonical gospels and is shown as being a close follower of jesus mary s presence at the crucifixion and jesus s tomb while hardly conclusive is at least consonant with the role of grieving wife and widow although if that were the case jesus might have been expected to make provision for her care as well as for his mother mary given the lack of contemporary documentation this scenario cannot be proven and although some consider the idea desirable to believe most scholars do not take it seriously on the other hand there is no direct evidence that jesus was unmarried either an argument for support of the married status of jesus is that bachelorhood was very rare for jewish males of jesus time being generally regarded as a transgression of the first mitzvah divine commandment be fruitful and multiply according to this reasoning it would have been unthinkable for an adult unmarried jew to travel about teaching as a rabbi a counter argument to this is that the judaism of jesus time was very diverse and the role of the rabbi was not yet well defined it was really not until after the roman destruction of the second temple in a d seven zero that rabbinic judaism became dominant and the role of the rabbi made uniform in jewish communities before jesus celibate teachers were known in the communities of the essenes and john the baptist also was celibate later paul of tarsus was an example of an unmarried itinerant teacher among christians jesus himself approved of voluntary celibacy for religious reasons and explicitly rejected a duty to marry there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven he

vinci code such as the truth behind the da vinci code two zero zero four written by richard abanes and the da vinci fraud by robert m price two zero zero five of the jesus seminar the australian scholar barbara thiering claims that a full account of the marriage and children of jesus and mary magdalene can be derived from the new testament by use of the pesher technique however both her method and her findings have found little support from mainstream scholars metaphysical marriage writers employing metaphysical analogy and allegory assert that christ was already married to the church this image goes back to old testament depictions of the covenant between god and his people as a marriage especially in the books hosea ezekiel and the song of songs imagery of marriage also appears in the gospels and is applied to jesus in the apocalypse of john in the new testament this was later expanded by the church fathers some writers following an early tradition that jesus is in a mystical sense the second adam that began with paul and continued with irenaeus and others embody this sense with literal parallels like the first adam his bride was taken from his side when he had fallen asleep died on the cross in medieval christian anagogic exegesis the blood and water which came from his side when he was pierced was held to represent the bringing forth of the church with its analogy in the water of baptism and the wine of the new covenant thus christ can be said in an allegorical sense to already have a wife in the church by shifting from the metaphysical analogy to a literal marriage it can then be considered impossible or intolerable to believe that he was literally married see also list of ancient mysteries saint sarah pistis sophia external links church of mary

and november one nine six seven some observers described the creature as a man sized beast with wings and large reflective red eyes while others claimed that the creature possessed luminous eyes a number of hypotheses have been put forward to explain what people reported ranging from paranormal phenomena to owls but no definitive explanation seems likely at this time history the mothman creature named in parallel to the tv series batman that was popular at the time was first sighted november one two one nine six six a group of five men were preparing a grave in a cemetery close to clendenin west virginia when what they described as a brown human shape with wings lifted off from behind nearby trees and flew over their heads however this sighting was not made public until later and the first sighting described in the media took place three days later late at night on november one five two young married couples from point pleasant roger and linda scarberry and steve and mary mallette were out for a drive in the scarberrys car they were passing a world war ii tnt factory about seven miles outside of point pleasant in the two five zero zero acre one zero km mcclintic wildlife station when they noticed two red lights in the shadow by an old generator plant near the gate of the factory they stopped the car and were startled to see that the lights were the glowing red eyes of a large animal shaped like a man but bigger maybe six and a half or seven feet tall with big wings folded against its back according to roger scarberry terrified the couples drove off in their car heading for route six two going down the exit road they saw the creature again standing on a ridge near the road it spread its wings and took off following their car to the city limits they went to the mason county courthouse and told their story to deputy millard halstead who later said i ve known these kids all their lives they d never been in any trouble and they were really scared that night i took them seriously he followed roger scarberry s car back to the tnt factory but found no sign of the strange creature the next night november one six local townspeople armed went searching the area around the old tnt plant for signs of mothman mr and mrs raymond wamsley and mrs marcella bennett with her baby daughter teena were in a car on their way to visit their friends mr and mrs ralph thomas who lived in a bungalow among the igloos concrete dome shaped structures erected for explosives storage during wwii close to the tnt plant the igloos were now empty some owned by the county some by companies intending to use them for storage they were headed back to their car when a figure appeared behind their parked car mrs bennett said it seemed like it had been lying down slowly rising up from the ground large and gray with glowing red eyes while wamsley phoned the police the creature walked onto the porch and peered in through the window at them on november two four four people saw it flying through the air over the tnt area on the morning of november two five thomas ury who was driving along route six two north of the tnt who said he saw the creature standing in a field by the road then spread its wings and take off following his car as he sped into point pleasant to report it to the sheriff on november two six mrs ruth foster of the charleston west virginia suburb of st albans saw mothman standing on her front lawn but it was gone when her brother in law went out to look on the morning of the two seven th it pursued a young woman near mason west virginia

british edition of the mothman prophecies there are several theories for what the mothman phenomena involved the largest collection of material about mothman is found in john keel s one nine seven five book the mothman prophecies in which keel lays out the chronology of mothman and what he claims to be related parapsychological events in the area including ufo activity men in black encounters poltergeist activity and the december one five one nine six seven collapse of the silver bridge across the ohio river the book was the basis of a two zero zero two movie starring richard gere directed by mark pellington loren coleman in the two zero zero two book mothman and other curious encounters focusing on the details of cryptozoology investigations acknowledges keel s demonological approach coleman first wrote about winged weirdies in articles and his one nine seven eight book creatures of the outer edge some of the explanations given for spring heeled jack which was sighted during the victorian era in england may possibly also be applied to the mothman skeptics have argued notably in the march april two zero zero two issue of the magazine skeptical inquirer that the most likely explanation of the sightings is excited eyewitnesses mistaking a barn owl some have argued that the most likely candidate however is the great horned owl since west virginia is home to the biggest variety of great horned owls in the world this secretive nocturnal bird can walk upright on the ground which gives it an uncanny resemblance to a child sized gray fuzzy creature with wings that spread to up to five feet wide the great grey owl a rare winter visitor to the lower forty eight states is even larger than the great horned owl and could possibly have been the figure behind some of the mothman sightings another possibility is the misidentification of tall gray sandhill crane seeing either a sandhill crane or a great grey owl in west virginia would be a rare but by no means impossible experience while it is plausible that some witnesses might have misidentified a large bird this hypothesis may have its flaws owls do not have enormous red eyes set in their chests and do not fly at high speed without flapping their wings mark a hall in his book thunderbirds disputes the owl theory but instead suggests a giant cryptid owl species allegedly seen in the area for over one zero zero years popular culture book in the cthulhu mythos originally created by h p lovecraft there is a race of aliens known as byakhee while the creatures were invented long before the actual mothman sightings it is interesting to note that the byakhee have many similarities to the mothmen in the cthulhu mythos universe it is possible that the byakhee were the basis for the mothmen

has revealed that this concept originated with european researchers including percy smith who attempted to cobble together various unrelated m ori legends the spurious fleet scenario was then accepted by some m ori including te rangi hiroa sir peter buck and won general acceptance until it was debunked in the one nine six zero s by the research of david simmons and others in fact nowhere in the

m ori were hunters fishermen and gardeners after arriving in new zealand m ori had to rapidly adapt their material culture and agricultural practices to suit the climate of their new land cold and harsh in comparison to tropical island polynesia great ingenuity was required to grow the tropical plants they had brought with them from polynesia including taro kumara gourds and yams this was especially difficult in the chillier southern parts of the country the harakeke flax plant served as a replacement for coconut fronds and hibiscus fibre in the manufacture of mats baskets rope fishing nets and clothing seasonal activities included gardening fishing and the hunting of birds main tasks were separated for men and women but there were also a lot of group activities involving food gathering however this idea is controversial tapu can be interpreted as sacred as spiritual restriction or implied prohibition it involves rules and prohibitions there are two kinds of tapu the private relating to individuals and the public tapu relating to communities a person an object or a place which is tapu may not be touched by human contact in some cases not even approached a person object or a place could be made sacred by tapu for a certain time in earlier times tribal members of a higher rank would not touch objects which belonged to members of a lower rank this was considered pollution and persons of a lower rank could not touch the belongings of a highborn person death was the penalty a violation of tapu could have dire consequences including the death of the offender through sickness or at the hands of someone affected by the offence in earlier times food cooked for a person of high rank was tapu and could not be eaten by an inferior a chief s house was tapu and even the chief could not eat food in the interior of his house not only were the houses of people of high rank perceived to be tapu but also their possessions including their clothing burial grounds and places of death were always tapu and these areas were often surrounded by a protective fence in pre contact society tapu was one of the strongest forces in m ori life however in the early one eight zero zero s m ori enthusiastically embraced christianity and its concepts and adapted them to their culture today tapu is still observed in matters relating to sickness death and burial dance and personal adornment haka haka performer the haka is just one of many kinds of group dance or performance a number of different types of haka are performed depending on the occasion there are haka of song and joy and warlike haka there are various types of war haka one performed without weapons usually to express public or private feelings is known as the haka taparahi another the peruperu is performed with weapons in former times the peruperu was performed before a battle its purpose was to invoke the god of war and to discourage and frighten the enemy it involved fierce facial expressions and grimaces poking out of the tongue eye bulging grunts and cries and the waving of weapons if the haka was not performed in total unison this was regarded as an bad omen for the battle often warriors went naked into battle apart from a plaited flax belt around the waist the aim of the warriors was to kill all the members of the enemy war party so that no survivors would remain to undertake revenge in today s environment however haka are often performed as a mark of respect for distinguished visitors or to express a sense of the importance of an occasion the new zealand national rugby team the all blacks perform a haka before international matches not only as a reflection of the importance of the game that is about to be played but also to motivate themselves and their supporters to greater efforts indirectly then as in days of old on the m ori battlefield they are paying a compliment to the perceived skills of their opponents pendants hei tiki neck pendantthe hei tiki a small ornamental pendant usually made of pounamu and worn around the neck is often incorrectly referred to as a tiki a term that actually refers to large human figures carved in wood and also the small wooden carvings used to mark sacred places one theory of the origin of the hei tiki suggests a connection with tiki the deity who created human life in which case the hei tiki is a symbol of fertility another less romantic theory holds that it served merely for personal adornment the most valuable hei tiki are carved from greenstone or pounamu new zealand greenstone consists of either nephrite a type of jade in m ori pounamu or bowenite m ori tangiwai pounamu is esteemed highly by m ori for its beauty toughness and great hardness it is used not only for ornaments such as hei tiki and ear pendants but also for carving tools adzes and weapons named varieties include translucent green kahurangi whitish inanga semi transparent kawakawa and tangiwai or bowenite from the size and style of traditional examples of hei tiki it is likely that the stone was first cut in the form of a small adze the tilted head of the pitau variety of hei tiki derives from the properties of the stone its hardness and great value make it important to minimise the amount of the stone that has to be removed creating a hei tiki with traditional methods is a long arduous process during which the stone is smoothed by abrasive rubbing finally using sticks and water it is slowly shaped and the holes bored out after laborious and lengthy polishing the completed pendant is suspended by a plaited cord and secured by a loop and toggle other t onga treasured possessions used as items of personal adornment include bone carvings in the form of neck ornaments earrings or necklaces for many m ori the wearing of such items relates to m ori cultural identity they are also popular with young new zealanders of all backgrounds for whom the pendants relate to a more generalized sense of new zealand identity several artistic collectives have been established by m ori tribal groups these collectives have begun creating and exporting jewellery such as bone carved hei matau pendants and greenstone jewellery and other artistic items such as wood carvings and textiles several actors who have recently appeared in high profile movies filmed in new zealand have come back wearing such jewellery including viggo mortensen of the lord of the rings fame took to wearing a hei matau around his neck these trends have contributed towards a worldwide interest in traditional m ori culture and arts t moko main article t moko as a cultural practice tattooing t moko was brought by the m ori from their eastern polynesian homeland and the implements and methods employed were similar to those used in other parts of polynesia see buck one nine seven four two nine six cited in references below it is thought that in traditional society many or most high ranking persons were tattooed and those who went without tattoos were seen as persons of lower social status although simmons one nine nine seven cited below contains references throughout to servants who were tattooed with patterns that signalled that they were the slave of a high ranking chief the receiving of tattoos constituted an important milestone on a person s journey to maturity and was accompanied by many rites and rituals according to simmons in both men and women the patterns used were highly significant of a person s rank skills knowledge personal life history tribal affiliations and genealogy in contrast buck one nine seven four two nine eight thought that because t moko experts travelled widely to carry out their art the designs would have related more to the tribal affiliations of the tattooist rather than those of the tattooed apart from signalling status and rank another reason for the practice in traditional times was to make a person more attractive to the opposite sex the instrument used to tattoo in former times up to one nine two five was a bone chisel with an extremely sharp edge the first stage of the tattoo started with the carving of deep grooves into the skin see simmons one nine nine seven one nine next the chisel was dipped into a sooty pigment such as burnt kauri gum which was then smeared into the skin it was an extremely long and painful process and often leaves from the karaka tree were placed over the swollen incisions to hasten the healing process women were not as extensively tattooed with some exceptions only their lips and chin were decorated simmons also mentions that the use of the painful traditional tattooing implements began to be abandoned in favour of grouped metal needles starting from about one nine one zero ibid in recent years there has been a resurgence in the practice of tattooing for both men and women as a sign of cultural identity and a reflection of the general revival of the language and culture members of kapa haka concert parties often apply temporary markings to their faces to give an approximation of a tattooed appearance interactions with europeans european colonisation of new zealand occurred relatively recently causing the late new zealand historian michael king to state in his book the penguin history of new zealand that m ori were the last major human community on earth untouched and unaffected by the wider world the early european explorers including abel tasman and james cook reported encounters with m ori these early reports described the m ori as a fierce and proud warrior race inter tribal warfare was a way of life with the conquered being enslaved or in some cases eaten from as early as the one seven eight zero s m ori had encounters with european sealers and whalers some even crewed on their ships there was also a continuous trickle of escaped convicts from australia and deserters from visiting ships by one eight three zero it was estimated that there were as many as two zero zero zero p keh living among the m ori status varying from slaves through to high ranking advisors from prisoners to those who abandoned european culture and identified themselves as m ori p keh were valued for their ability to describe european skills and culture and their ability to obtain european items in trade particularly weaponry these europeans were known as p keh m ori when pomare led a war party against titore in one eight three eight among his warriors were one three two p keh mercenaries frederick edward maning an early settler wrote two colourful contemporaneous accounts of life at that time which have become classics of new zealand literature old new zealand and history of the war in the north of new zealand against the chief heke governor george grey learned the language and recorded much of the mythology during this period the acquisition of muskets by those tribes in close contact with european visitors destabilised the existing balance of power between m ori tribes and there was a period of bloody inter tribal warfare known as the musket wars during which several tribes were effectively exterminated and others were driven from their traditional territory european diseases also killed a large but unknown number of m ori during this period estimates vary between ten and fifty percent with increasing european missionary activity and settlement in the one eight three zero s as well as perceived european lawlessness the british crown as a predominant world power came under pressure to intervene ultimately this led to william hobson being dispatched with instructions to take possession of new zealand before he arrived queen victoria annexed new zealand by royal proclamation in january one eight four zero on arrival in february hobson negotiated the treaty of waitangi with the surrounding northern chiefs this treaty was subsequently signed by many other m ori chiefs though by no means all the treaty made the m ori british subjects in return for a guarantee of property rights and tribal autonomy in the one eight six zero s disputes over questionable land purchases and the attempts of m ori in the waikato to establish a rival british style system of royalty led to the new zealand wars although these resulted in relatively few deaths large tracts of tribal land were confiscated by the colonial government settlements such as parihaka in taranaki are remembered as sites of violent conflict that took place there during that period revival with the loss of much of their land m ori went into a period of decline and by the late one nine th century it was believed that the m ori population would cease to exist as a separate race and be assimilated into the european population the predicted decline did not occur and population levels recovered despite a high degree of intermingling between the m ori and european populations m ori were able to retain their cultural identity and in the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s m oridom underwent a cultural revival no m ori live a traditional pre european contact lifestyle today some commentators express frustration with the theme parkisation of m ori identity with tourist driven performances and gift shop art others seek to develop a new zealand identity that incorporates strands of m ori identity sympathetic governments and political activism have led to compensation for certain historic instances of unjust confiscation of land and the violation of other property rights a special court the waitangi tribunal was established to investigate and make recommendations on such issues as a result of the compensation paid m ori now have significant interests in the fishing and forestry industries in many areas of new zealand m ori language ceased to be used as a living community language by significant numbers of people in the post war years generous state funding is assisting with the revival attempt m ori culture and language is taught in most new zealand schools and pre school kohanga reo or language nests teach tamariki or young children exclusively in m ori m ori television a government funded tv station committed to broadcasting primarily in te reo began broadcasting on march two eight two zero zero four m ori language has the equivalent status to english in government and law m ori politicians have seven designated m ori seats in the new zealand parliament and may stand in the general seats and consideration and consultation with m ori are routine requirements for many new zealand councils and government organisations despite significant social and economic advances during the two zero th century m ori still perform negatively in most health and education statistics labour participation as well as being over represented in criminal and corrections statistics in two zero zero one a dispute arose between danish toymaker lego and several m ori tribal groups fronted by lawyer maui solomon and also several members of an online discussion forum aotearoa cafe over the popular lego toy line bionicle the product line used many words that were an appropriation of m ori language imagery and folklore the dispute was settled amicably initially lego refused to withdraw the game saying the names it used were drawn from many cultures but later agreed that it had taken the names from m ori and agreed to change certain names or spellings to help set the toy line apart from the m ori legends this however did not prevent the many bionicle users from continuing to use the disputed words resulting in the popular bionicle website bzpower coming under

technology uses to accomplish platform independence and runtime safety msil competes with the java virtual machine byte code general information during compilation of net programming languages the source code is translated into msil code rather than machine specific object code msil is a cpu and platform independent instruction set that can be executed in any environment supporting the net framework msil code is verified for safety during runtime providing better security and reliability than natively compiled binaries just in time jit compilation this technique involves the byte code being turned into code immediately executable by the cpu the conversion is performed gradually during the program s execution jit compilation provides environment specific optimization runtime type safety and assembly verification to accomplish this the jit compiler examines the assembly metadata for any illegal accesses and handles violations appropriately ngen native image generator compilation ngen allows to produce a native binary image for the current environment the byte code is either skipped entirely or converted into native cpu instructions completly before runtime this eliminates the jit overhead at the expense of portability whenever an ngen generated image is run in an incompatible environment net framework automatically reverts to using jit once ngen is run against an assembly the resulting native image is placed into the global assembly cache for use by all other net assemblies it is advised that ngen is run during applications deployment metadata metadata is information about the compiled classes it serves the same purpose as a type library in com metadata enables applications to support and discover the interfaces of classes in the assembly the process of reading metadata is called reflection center see also java virtual machine compiler bytecode parrot virtual machine virtual machine malcolm x may one nine one nine two five february two one one nine six five born malcolm little also known as detroit red el hajj malik el shabazz and omowale was a longtime spokesman for the nation of islam he was also founder of the muslim mosque inc and the organization of afro american unity during his life malcolm went from being a street wise boston hoodlum to one of the most prominent black nationalist leaders in the united states as a militant leader malcolm x advocated black pride economic self reliance and identity politics he ultimately rose to become a world renowned african american pan africanist and human rights activist malcolm x was assassinated in new york city on february two one one nine six five on the first day of national brotherhood week name he explained the name he chose by saying to take one s x is to take on a certain mystery a certain possibility of power in the eyes of one s peers and one s enemies the x announced what you had been and what you had become ex smoker ex drinker ex christian ex slave the x also stood for the unknown original surname of the slaves from whom malcolm x descended in preference to continuing to use a name which would have been given by the slave owner this rationale made many members of the nation of islam choose their own surname they could only choose x birth and early years young malcolm x malcolm little was born in omaha nebraska to earl little and louise little n e norton his father an outspoken baptist lay preacher and supporter of marcus garvey was believed to have been killed by the black legion a white supremacist group in lansing michigan in one nine three one malcolm and his siblings had been split up and sent to different foster homes when louise little was declared legally insane in one nine three nine she was formally committed to the state mental hospital at kalamazoo michigan and remained there until malcolm and his brothers and sisters got her released twenty six years later malcolm graduated from junior high school at the top of his class but dropped out soon after an admired teacher told him that aspirations of being a lawyer were no realistic goal for a nigger after enduring a series of foster homes malcolm was first sent to a detention center and then later moved to boston to live with his older half sister ella little collins he found work as a shoe shiner at a lindy hop nightclub in his autobiography he says that he once shined the shoes of duke ellington and other notable black musicians after some time he moved to new york city where in harlem he became involved in drug dealing gambling pimping racketeering and robbery referred to collectively by malcolm as hustling when he was examined for the world war ii draft military physicians classified him to be mentally disqualified for military service he explains in his autobiography that putting on a display to avoid the draft he told the examining officer that he couldn t wait to get his hands on a gun so he could kill some crackers prison malcolm became a small time hustler and was known on the street as detroit red due to his lighter skin tone and hair color he was arrested in boston on january one two one nine four six at the age of two zero and sentenced to eight to ten years imprisonment on charges of breaking and entering carrying firearms and larceny he later earned the nickname satan in the charlestown state prison for his constant cursing especially of god and the bible while in jail in one nine four eight he received letters from his brother reginald asking him to join the nation of islam noi the noi defined itself as a militant islamic sect for black people that preached that most african slaves were muslims before they were captured and sent to the americas they argued that black people should reconvert to islam to reclaim the heritage that was stolen from them the noi considered itself to be a black nationalist group which supported the idea of a separate black nation within the united states malcolm diligently studied the teachings of the nation of islam s leader elijah muhammad his sister ella helped to transfer him to the lower security prison colony in norfolk massachusetts where he became an avid reader and found justification for the teachings of elijah muhammad and the nation of islam in history and philosophy he participated in the colony s weekly debates and copied an entire dictionary from the colony s library to expand his knowledge and to improve his handwriting his first contact with elijah muhammad was in prison where he corresponded with muhammad by mail as he progressed in his self education he began to write to the leader daily after his release on parole on august seven one nine five two he bought a suitcase eyeglasses and a watch later saying that these were the items he used most in his later life nation of islam malcolm with elijah muhammad at savior s day in one nine five two after his release from prison malcolm went to meet elijah muhammad in chicago malcolm wasn t allowed to receive his x yet because he simply hadn t had enough insight study and understanding of the nation the x is meant to symbolize the rejection of his slave name and the absence of an african name the x is also both a reference to the name given to the slaves by the anglo european slave owners unwilling to learn their african names and is also the brand that many slaves received on their upper arm in march of one nine five three the fbi opened a file on malcolm supposedly in response to an allegation that he had described himself as a communist according to the church committee the fbi had long been used to monitor disrupt and repress radicals like malcolm included in the file were two letters wherein malcolm uses the alias malachi shabazz in message to the black man in america elijah muhammad explained the name shabazz as belonging to descendants of an asian black nation in may of one nine five three the federal bureau of investigation concluded that malcolm x had an asocial personality with paranoid trends pre psychotic paranoid schizophrenia and had in fact sought treatment for his disorder this was further supported by a letter intercepted by the fbi dated june two nine one nine five zero the letter said in reference to his four f classification and rejection by the military everyone has always said malcolm is crazy so it isn t hard to convince people that i am later that year malcolm left his half sister ella in boston to stay with elijah muhammad in chicago he soon returned to boston and became the minister of the nation of islam s temple number eleven his active membership in the nation of islam led to him opening several temples around the country of which he often became minister his rousing incendiary and inspirational speeches and spotless personal example led to the ranks of the nation of islam burgeoning his preaching also inspired the famous boxer and political activist cassius clay to join the nation of islam and change his name to muhammad ali and similarly ali later left the noi and joined mainstream islam malcolm was soon seen as the number two man in the movement next to elijah muhammad himself he was largely credited with increasing membership in the noi from five zero zero in one nine five two to three zero zero zero zero in one nine six three marriage in one nine five eight malcolm married betty x n e sanders in lansing michigan they had six daughters together all of whom carried the surname of shabazz attallah also spelled attillah born in one nine five eight qubilah born in one nine six zero ilyasah born in one nine six two gamilah also spelled gumilah born in one nine six four and twins malaak and malikah born after malcolm s death in one nine six five tensions in the early one nine six zero s malcolm was increasingly exposed to rumors of elijah muhammad s extramarital affairs with young secretaries adultery is severely shunned in the teachings of the nation of islam at first he brushed these rumors aside later he spoke with the women making the accusations and believed them in one nine six three elijah muhammad himself confirmed to malcolm that the rumors were true and claimed that this followed a pattern established by biblical prophets despite being unsatisfied with the excuses and being disenchanted by other ministers using nation of islam funds to line their own pockets malcolm s faith in elijah muhammad did not waver by the summer of one nine six three tension in the nation of islam reached a boiling point malcolm believed that elijah muhammad was jealous of his popularity as were several senior ministers malcolm watched the march on washington critically unable to understand why black people were excited over a demonstration run by whites in front of a statue of a president who has been dead for a hundred years and who didn t like us when he was alive later in the year following the john f kennedy assassination malcolm delivered a speech as he regularly would however when asked to comment upon the assassination he replied that it was a case of chickens coming home to roost that the violence that kennedy had failed to stop and at times refused to rein in had come around to claim his life most explosively he then added that with his country origins chickens coming home to roost never made me sad it only made me glad this comment led to widespread public outcry and led to the nation of islam s publicly censuring malcolm x although retaining his post and rank as minister he was banned from public speaking for ninety days by elijah muhammad himself malcolm obeyed and kept silent in the spring of one nine six three malcolm started collaborating on the autobiography of malcolm x with alex haley he also publicly announced his break from the nation of islam on march eight one nine six four and the founding of the muslim mosque inc on march one two one nine six four at this point malcolm mostly adhered to the teachings of the nation of islam but began modifying them explicitly advocating political and economic black nationalism as opposed to the noi s exclusivist religious nationalism in march and april he made the series of famous speeches called the ballot or the bullet malcolm was in contact with several orthodox muslims who encouraged him to learn about orthodox islam he soon converted to orthodox islam and as a result decided to make his hajj hajj on april one three one nine six four malcolm departed jfk airport new york for cairo egypt by way of frankfurt germany it was the second time malcolm had been to africa malcolm left cairo arriving in jeddah saudi arabia at about three in the morning he was automatically suspect due to his inability to speak arabic and his united states passport he was separated from the group he came with and was isolated he spent about two zero hours wearing the ihram a two piece towel outfit wrapping the wearer from the waist down with one towel and from the waist upward with the other it was at this time he remembered the book the eternal message of muhammad by abdul rahman hassan azzam and which dr mahmoud yousseff sharwabi had presented to him with his visa approval he called azzam s son who arranged for his release at the younger azzam s home he met azzam pasha who gave malcolm his suite at the jeddah palace hotel the next morning muhammad faisal the son of prince faisal visited and informed him that he was to be a state guest the deputy chief of protocol accompanied malcolm to the hajj court it therefore was a mere formality for sheikh muhammad harkon to allow malcolm to make his hajj pilgrimage to mecca on april one nine he completed the umrah making the seven circuits around the kaaba drinking from the well of zamzam and running between the hills of safah and marwah seven times the trip proved to be life altering he had come to see islam as the one religion that could erase all racial problems a changed man malcolm x on may two one one nine six four he returned to the united states as a traditional sunni muslim and with a new name el hajj malik el shabazz when malcolm returned to the united states he gave a speech about his visit this time he gave a much larger meaning and message than before the speech was not only for the muslims instead it was for the whole nation and for all races he said human rights are something you were born with human rights are your god given rights human rights are the rights that are recognized by all nations of this earth in the past yes i have made sweeping indictments of all white people i will never be guilty of that again as i know now that some white people are truly sincere that some truly are capable of being brotherly toward a black man the true islam has shown me that a blanket indictment of all white people is as wrong as when whites make blanket indictments against blacks since i learned the truth in mecca my dearest friends have come to include all kinds some christians jews buddhists hindus agnostics and even atheists i have friends who are called capitalists socialists and communists some of my friends are moderates conservatives extremists some are

the teachings and tradition of menno simons one four nine six one five six one as one of the historic peace churches mennonites are committed to non violence non resistance and pacifism or refusal to go to war there are over one million mennonites worldwide as of two zero zero six mennonite congregations worldwide embody the full scope of mennonite practice from old fashioned plain people to those who appear no different in dress from other people the largest population of mennonites is in the united states but mennonites congregrate in tight knit communities in many other countries as well mennonites are prominent among denominations in disaster relief often being the first to arrive with aid after hurricanes floods and other disasters in the last few decades they have also become more actively involved with peace and social justice issues helping to found christian peacemaker teams mennonite conciliation service and the mennonite central committee history background ulrich zwingli from before the middle ages to the early one five th century most christianity in western europe was known alternately as the universal or catholic church headed by the pope every infant born in europe was baptized the catholic church was of paramount importance to the daily life of the average person church services were conducted in latin which was the ecclesiastical language of the time because many common people were illiterate the church endeavored to instruct its members in the christian faith by means of artwork in church buildings statues paintings and stained glass windows when the printing press was invented around one four five five the bible was one of the first books printed and mass produced with movable type although illiteracy was still widespread more people could now read the bible and interpret it for themselves a factor leading to the protestant reformation in europe key reformers martin luther and john calvin broke with the catholic church each forming a new state church in zurich switzerland ulrich zwingli also left the priesthood to lead the reformation among the swiss cantons radical reformation and the anabaptists some of the followers of zwingli s reformed church felt that requiring church membership beginning at birth was inconsistent with the new testament example they felt that the church should be completely removed from government the proto free church tradition and that people should join only once they were willing to publicly acknowledge that they believed in jesus and wanted to live as he commanded at this time two groups who believed this were the hutterites and another group that would come to be known as mennonites however in the spirit of the times many other more radical groups followed preaching any number of ideas about hierarchy the state and various ideas on sexual license running from utter abandon to extreme chastity these movements have been called by historians the radical reformation modern day mennonites in addition to the amish and hutterites are the direct descendants of the radical reformation anabaptists many do not consider themselves to be protestants nor roman catholic but rather a separate radical reformation the protestant churches considered this radical idea of voluntary church membership to be dangerous they joined forces to fight the movement laws were passed and many people were persecuted robbed of everything they had driven from their homes and countries and martyred however some survived and at a small meeting of believers on january two one one five two five conrad grebel felix manz and george blaurock along with twelve other believers all baptized each other this meeting became the birthplace of the anabaptists or re baptizers as the movement spread slowly around europe primarily along the rhine river despite the best efforts of the state churches many of the earliest anabaptist leaders those whose beliefs were strongest and who were the most educated were killed in an effort to purge europe of this dangerous idea by one five three zero most of the leaders had been martyred or killed for refusing to renounce their beliefs their unwillingness to fight for their lives was a direct reflection of their belief that god did not condone killing or use of force for any reason and played a large part in the evolution of anabaptist theology when the most educated leaders of the movement were killed they were sometimes replaced by people who did not fully understand their predecessors philosophy and who felt that they had to fight to protect their lives and beliefs these branches were eventually destroyed by their very willingness to fight at the same time the branches that refused to engage the stronger enemy of the state churches still continued to be persecuted robbed of their possessions and forcefully moved but they survived and some became the forerunners of the modern mennonite church fragmentation and variation during the sixteenth century the mennonites and other anabaptists were relentlessly persecuted by the seventeenth century some of them joined the state church in switzerland and persuaded the authorities to relent in their attacks the mennonites outside the state church were divided on whether to remain in communion with their brothers within the state church and this led to a split those against remaining in communion with them became known as the amish after their founder jacob amman those who remained in communion with them retained the name mennonite this period of persecution has had a significant impact on mennonite identity martyrs mirror published in one six six zero documents much of the persecution of anabaptists and their predecessors today the book is still the most important book besides the bible for many mennonites and amish in particular for the swiss south german branch of mennonitism other disagreements over the years have led to other splits sometimes the reasons were theological sometimes practical sometimes geographical for instance near the beginning of the twentieth century there were some members in the amish church who wanted to begin having sunday schools and evangelize unable to persuade the rest of the amish they separated and formed the conservative mennonite conference mennonites in canada and other countries typically have independent denominations due to the practical considerations of distance and in some cases language menno simons menno simons in the early days of the anabaptist movement menno simons a catholic priest in the netherlands heard of the movement and started to rethink his catholic faith he questioned the doctrine of transubstantiation but was reluctant to leave the roman catholic church his thinking was influenced by the death of his brother who as a member of an anabaptist group was killed when he and his companions were attacked and refused to defend themselves in one five three six at the age of four zero simons left the roman catholic church soon thereafter he became a leader within the anabaptist movement he would become a hunted man with a price on his head for the rest of his life his name became associated with scattered groups of nonviolent anabaptists he helped to organize and consolidate persecution welcoming monarchs and early america the first recorded account of this group is in a written order by countess anne who ruled a small province in central europe the presence of some small groups of violent anabaptists was causing political and religious turmoil in her state so she decreed that all anabaptists were to be driven from her state the order made an exception though for the non violent branch known at that time as the menists this order set the precedent that was to be repeated many times throughout history where a political ruler would allow the menists or mennonites into his her state because they were honest hardworking and peaceful however inevitably their presence would ruffle the feathers of the powerful state churches or a new monarch would take power and the mennonites would once again be forced to flee for their lives usually leaving everything but their families behind often another monarch in another state would grant them welcome at least for a while an example was the ruling queen of england elizabeth i there in a small village in britain a group of dutch anabaptists made the acquaintance of a congregation led by john smythe who would later lead his pilgrims to the netherlands and then to the america the pilgrims exposure to the dutch mennonite congregation probably influenced some of their teachings including the freedom of each branch to regulate itself although the pilgrims known today as the congregational church kept their practice of infant baptism despite the mennonites belief that baptism should take place only once the person had the capacity and willingness to accept jesus as their lord and savior in addition to the mennonites impact on the first american pilgrims religious historians have traced their impact to other religious teachings this included the baptist s emphasis of adult baptism upon confession of faith and the religious society of friends quakers strong stance against war the dissemination of anabaptist beliefs helped build the religious freedom that is enjoyed in america today the netherlands origins of community and simplicity while mennonites in colonial america were enjoying a large degree of religious freedom their counterparts in europe were in largely the same situation they always had been their well being still depended on a ruling monarch who would often extend an invitation only when there was poor soil that no one else could farm the exception to this rule being in the netherlands where the mennonites enjoyed a relatively high degree of tolerance the mennonites would reclaim this land through hard work and good sense in exchange for exemption from mandatory military service however once the land was arable again this arrangement would often change and the persecution would again set in because the land still needed to be tended the ruler would not drive the mennonites out but would actually pass laws to force them to stay while at the same time severely limiting their freedom mennonites had to build their churches facing onto back streets or alleys which began the habit of meeting in someone s home rather than a formal church and they were forbidden from announcing the beginning of services with the sound of a bell in addition high taxes were enacted in exchange for both continuing the military service exemption and to keep the states best farmers from leaving usually however in the tradition established by the earliest martyrs the mennonites were willing to pay any price rather than give up their freedom of conscience in some cases the entire congregation would give up their belongings to pay the tax to be allowed to leave if one member of the group or one family couldn t afford the tax the other members of the group happily paid that burden this strong sense of community remains to this day one of the strongest ties that binds mennonites together as a community in addition by having to often give up every earthly possession in order to retain individual freedoms the mennonites learned to live very simply this was reflected both in the home and at church where not only dress but the buildings themselves were very plain even the music at church which was usually simple german chorales were performed with no more elaborate instrument than the human voice jacob amman and the amish mennonites suffered the first church split while still in an area between france and germany known as alsace in one six nine three jacob amman led an effort to reform the mennonite church to include a stronger ban to have communion more often and other differences when the discussions fell through jacob and his followers left the mennonite church to form the amish church though the difference was originally theological the many plain sects that are lumped together as the amish church have come to be recognized for the practice of accepting technology selectively for instance many sects accept battery powered cellphones but strictly limit wired telephones and power line electricity in order to comply with the demands of romans one two two and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god though the plain sects in southeast pennsylvania are sometimes referred to as the pennsylvania dutch that term actually encompasses a much larger cultural linguistic group than just the amish including mennonites and non plain german reformed church groups as well as they do not proselytize amish are almost always part of the larger pennsylvania german ethnic group that emigrated to pennsylvania in the one seven two zero s and three zero s even though the first permanent mennonite settlement in america was actually formed in one six eight three and called germantown some few are of swiss welsh french english and scottish ancestry old order mennonites some mennonite communities conscientiously reject the use of modern technology such as electricity or motor transport much the same as the amish denominations to whom they are related such mennonites are often referred to as old order mennonites although the term strictly refers to a particular church within that group in order to distinguish them from mennonite denominations that fully accept modern inventions they also reject modern notions of insurance preferring to rely on their neighbors when disaster strikes old order mennonites have a distinctive form of dress which they call plain often looking rather like central european countrymen in addition to old order mennonites throughout the united states and canada there are many groups of conservative mennonites whose practice of new testament teachings makes them distinct from the larger western culture many of these groups withdrew from mainstream mennonite groups during the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s during that time mainstream groups were abandoning traditional mennonite practices such as the headship veiling for women modesty and simplicity in dress ordination from the laity and nonparticipation in government in the years since the groups that have held to a literal interpretation of biblical mennonite practices such as the headship veiling have actually increased at a much more rapid rate than those groups that have rejected these standards the russian mennonites catherine the great of russia who acquired a great deal of land north of the black sea in the present day ukraine in one seven six eight following a war with the turks invited those mennonites living in prussia to come farm the cold tough soil of the russian steppes in exchange for religious freedom and military exemption the arrangement remained in place for many years during her rule until she died and the next monarch came to power the mennonites that had settled in russia during that time have come to be known to history as the russian mennonites avoiding the worldliness of the outside world remains another important keystone in the foundation of the mennonite faith however as with all groups worldliness is virtually impossible to keep out in the mennonite colonies of russia the mennonites grew financially prosperous in sharp contrast to the ex serfs around them industrial operations were started and grew farms grew large and successful with prosperity came a certain amount of licentiousness including reported fondness for alcohol and greed although by no means accepted by all these habits created strife within communities especially when leadership was unwilling to ask for changes in behaviour occasionally pietist movements often influenced by baptist missionaries from germany formed groups opposed to the accepted community ways one particular group formed was the mennonite brethren who left to form their own colonies eventually after many years of prosperity the colonies of russian mennonites were torn apart by war famine disease and finally mass expulsions under the soviet union the state of kansas owes its reputation as a wheat producing state to its early mennonite settlers as a result of their time on the russian steppes under catherine the great they were familiar with a strain of wheat known as winter wheat that was resistant to the cold of the american plains it was planted in the fall and harvested in the following summer and was therefore ideally suited to hot dry kansas summers they brought it with them when the railroads were seeking farmers for the land owned on either side of the tracks and today kansas is a top producer of wheat in america swiss volhynian mennonites settled in the moundridge kansas and pretty prairie kansas areas the swiss mennonite cultural and historical association tells their story mennonites of dutch prussian low german descent settled much of south central kansas one of the largest churches with low german roots is the alexanderwohl mennonite church in goessel kansas after one eight seven zero many russian mennonites fearing state influence on their education systems emigrated to the plains states of the us and the western provinces of canada they brought with them many of their institutions and practices including separate denominations heretofore unseen in north america like the mennonite brethren the largest group of russian mennonites came out of russia after the bloody strife following the various russian revolutions and the aftermath of wwi these people having lost everything they had known found their way to settlements in alberta saskatchewan manitoba british columbia and ontario and in many regions of the united states some joined with previous mennonite groups while others formed their own from there many groups fearing state persecution and searching for a way to live quietly on the land have left to form groups in paraguay belize and mexico beginning in the one nine two zero s old colony mennonites went from mexico and belize in the early one nine seven zero s and to argentina in one nine eight six a smaller number of russian mennonites emigrated as refugees along with the retreating german army after the failed german campaign of world war ii mennonites in early american history one of the first groups of mennonites to migrate to the american colonies consisted of thirteen families of dutch extraction who arrived from krefeld germany in one six eight three and settled in germantown pennsylvania among these early settlers was william rittenhouse a lay minister and owner of the first american paper mill in the one eight th century one zero zero zero zero zero germans from the palatinate collectively known as the pennsylvania dutch immigrated to pennsylvania of these around two five zero zero were mennonites and five zero zero amish this group settled farther west than the first group choosing less expensive land in the lancaster pennsylvania area a member of this second group christopher dock authored pedagogy the first american monograph on education during the colonial period mennonites were distinguished from other pennslvania germans in three ways their opposition to the revolutionary war resistance to public education and disapproval of religious revivalism contributions of mennonites during this period include the idea of separation of church and state and opposition to slavery when william penn was settling pennsylvania he visited mennonite settlements in europe offering full religious freedom and exemption from military service mennonites that came to pennsylvania objected to the practice of american quakers who owned slaves the first written protest against slavery in america though often credited to the friends was signed mostly by german mennonites who had become quakers retaining their anti slavery beliefs the treatise was addressed to american quakers in an effort to change their ways from one eight one two to one eight six zero another wave of immigrants settled farther west in ohio indiana illinois and missouri these swiss speaking mennonites along with amish came from switzerland and the alsace lorraine area oberholtzer and the general conference one of the more recent branches was initiated involuntarily by john h oberholtzer in the mid one eight zero zero s he believed strongly in the right of each congregation to regulate itself and felt that many of the church leaders were trying to gain too much control over the individual congregations they were mandating issues as small as style of dress and splitting when such trivial issues couldn t be agreed upon in his effort to reunite the church under a general conference he gained support of numerous congregations and pastors but not the entire church the result was that the congregations who supported oberholtzer s idea came to be known as the general conference mennonite church organized in one eight six zero one of the general conference s greatest contributions was the idea that if a person didn t agree with the leadership of his particular congregation he was allowed simply to change membership to another without embarrassment or scandal of any kind this idea along with many others unique to the general conference mennonites made membership more attractive to newer european and russian mennonites who tended to join the general conference rather than the old mennonites the other major outgrowth of the general conference mennonites was to fulfill john oberholtzer s passion of working together in outreach and mission he felt that with all the mennonite churches working together they could accomplish great things in mission even though he failed to unite all churches under this cause the general conference supported more service including more missionaries to various parts of the world in the years since the formation of the general conference several service organizations were created which drew on support from several mennonite denominations these included the mennonite central committee mcc founded in one nine two zero and voluntary service vs programs sponsored by the mennonite board of missions as well as mennonite mutual aid world war ii mennonites in canada were automatically exempt from any type of service during world war i by provisions of the order in council of one eight seven three during world war ii mennonite conscientious objectors were given the options of noncombatant military service serving in the medical or dental corps under military control or working in parks and on roads under civilian supervision over nine five chose the latter and were placed in alternative service camps initially the men worked on road building forestry and firefighting projects after may one nine four three as the labor shortaged developed within the nation men were shifted into agriculture

throughout the united states and puerto rico the draftees worked in areas such as soil conservation forestry fire fighting agriculture social services and mental health the cps men served without wages and minimal support from the federal government the cost of maintaining the cps camps and providing for the needs of the men was the responsibility of their congregations and families mennonite central committee coordinated the operation of the mennonite camps cps men served longer than regular draftees not being released until well past the end of the war initially skeptical of the program government agencies learned to appreciate the men s service and requested more workers from the program cps made significant contributions to forest fire prevention erosion and flood control medical science and reform of the mental health system population distribution growth and organization according to mennonite church usa sources there were about one two million mennonites worldwide in two zero zero three north america had the highest number of mennonites about four four four zero zero zero closely followed by africa with about four zero six zero zero zero members the third largest concentration of mennonites was in the asia pacific region with about one eight four zero zero zero members while the fourth largest region was south central america and the caribbean with about one one two zero zero zero members europe the birthplace of mennonites fell a distant last with about five eight zero zero zero members with the fastest growth rate by far africa seems poised to overtake north america within the decade as the continent with the largest number of mennonites growth in mennonite membership is slow but steady in north america the asia pacific region and the south central america and caribbean region europe has seen a slow and accelerating decline in mennonite membership since about one nine eight zero there is no single authorized organization that includes all mennonite denominations worldwide instead the majority of mennonite denominations are entirely autonomous these include groups of old order mennonite churches the orthodox church of god in christ mennonite along with other conservative or plain mennonite churches worldwide there are also many mainstream and progressive mennonites who worship in autonomous churches worldwide because of the wide scope of mennonite worship from rigid orthodox to tolerant progressive that occurs among these groups it is difficult to classify these mennonites other than as the autonomous majority of mennonites in the united states and worldwide a minority of mennonite denominations belong to governing groups called churches the larger of these groups are the mennonite brethren a worldwide church and the mennonite church divided into mennonite church usa and mennonite church canada the churches are typically divided into conferences along geographical lines the mennonite brethren have conferences in india africa japan the united states and japan along with independent congregations in germany the mennonite church usa consists of around twenty regional conferences in the united states and canada the mennonite world conference is a community of anabaptist related churches it exists to facilitate community between anabaptist related churches worldwide and relate to other christian world communions and organizations but it is not a governing body of any kind it facilitates community between all willing amish mennonites and hutterites and relates them to the wider world in the united states in two zero zero three the majority estimated from two zero zero zero statistics of mennonites were members in independent denominations outside of the mennonite church usa organization these independent denominations were lumped together as other groups in the mennonite church usa statistics so no sound distinctions between orthodox mainstream progressive mennonite denominations is possible here the total membership in mennonite church usa denominations decreased from about one three three zero zero zero in one nine nine eight before the merger to about one one four zero zero zero in two zero zero three a distinct minority of the three two zero zero zero zero plus mennonites in the united states theology mennonite theology emphasizes the primacy of the teachings of jesus as recorded in new testament scripture they hold in common the ideal of a religious community based on new testament models and imbued with the spirit of the sermon on the mount their core beliefs deriving from anabaptist traditions are the authority of scripture and the holy spirit salvation through conversion by the spirit of god believer s baptism understood as threefold baptism by the spirit internal change of heart baptism by water public demonstration of witness and baptism by blood martyrdom and asceticism or the practice of strict self denial as a measure of personal and especially spiritual discipline discipleship understood as an outward sign of an inward change discipline in the church informed by new testament teaching particularly of jesus for example matthew one eight one five one eight some mennonite churches practice the ban shunning the lord s supper understood as a memorial rather than as a sacrament or christian rite ideally shared by baptized believers within the unity and discipline of the church one of the earliest expressions of their faith was the schleitheim confession adopted in one five two seven zero two two four its seven articles covered

seven february one nine nine two in maastricht between the members of the european community and entered into force on one november one nine nine three under the delors commission it led to the creation of the european union and was the result of separate negotiations on monetary union and on political union the treaty led to the creation of the euro and introduced the three pillar structure the economic and social policy pillar the common foreign and security policy or cfsp pillar and the justice and home affairs pillar the cfsp pillar was built on the foundation of european political cooperation epc but brought it under a treaty and extended it the jha pillar introduced cooperation in law enforcement criminal justice civil judicial matters and asylum and immigration originally the european community ec dealt mainly with economic and trade matters the european commission and the european court of justice both independent from the ec governments had a lot of power within the system the european parliament which was directly elected by the citizens of the ec member states also had some power the governments controlled the remainder of the power but since the mid one nine eight zero s had increasingly been doing so through majority votes this system was called the community method or supranationalism since international institutions not directly controlled by the governments wielded a lot of power and members could have decisions they disagreed with imposed upon them through majority votes it was desired to add competencies in foreign policy military and criminal matters to the european community however many member states considered that these areas were too sensitive to be managed by the mechanisms of the european community and that the power of governments in relation to these areas had to be stronger than the powers of governments in the european community that is an intergovernmental as opposed to supranational system would have to be used other member states feared that this might threaten the power of the independent supranational institutions the european commission european court of justice and european parliament in relation to the economic matters then dealt with by the european community the three pillar structure was then developed to isolate the traditional community responsibilities in the area of the economy the community pillar from the new competencies in the areas of foreign policy and military matters the cfsp pillar and criminal matters the jha pillar the maastricht treaty was signed on february seven one nine

saxony anhalt in western music motet is a word that is applied to a number of highly varied choral musical compositions the name comes either from the latin movere to move or a latinized version of old french mot word or verbal utterance the mediaeval latin for motet is motectum if from the latin the name describes the movement of the different voices against one another according to margaret bent one nine nine seven a piece of music in several parts with words is as precise a definition of the motet as will serve from the thirteenth to the late sixteenth century and beyond this is actually very close to one of the earliest descriptions we have that of the late thirteenth century theorist johannes de grocheio grocheio was also one of the first scholars to define a motet grocheio believed that the motet was not intended for the vulgar who do not understand its finer points and derive no pleasure from hearing it it is meant for educated people and those who look for refinement in art medieval motets the earliest motets arose in the thirteenth century bent one nine nine seven out of the organum tradition exemplified in the notre dame school of l onin and p rotin the motet arose from discant clausula sections usually strophic interludes in a longer sequence of organum to which upper voices were added usually the discant represented a strophic sequence in latin which was sung as a discant over a cantus firmus which typically was a gregorian chant fragment with different words from the discant the motet took a definite rhythm from the words of the verse and as such appeared as a brief rhythmic interlude in the middle of the longer more chantlike organum the practice of discant over a cantus firmus marked the beginnings of counterpoint in western music from these first motets arose a medieval tradition of secular motets these were two or three part compositions in which several different texts sometimes in different vernacular languages were sung simultaneously over a latin cantus firmus that once again was usually adapted from a passage of gregorian chant it is suspected that for the sake of intelligibility in performance the cantus firmus and one or another of the vocal lines were performed on instruments increasingly in the one four th and one five th centuries motets tended to be isorhythmic that is they employed repeated rhythmic patterns in all voices not just the cantus firmus which did not necessarily coincide with repeating melodic patterns philippe de vitry was one of the earliest composers to use this technique and his work evidently had an influence on that of guillaume de machaut one of the most famous named composers of late medieval motets renaissance motets the name of the motet was preserved in the transition from medieval to renaissance music but the character of the composition was entirely changed while it grew out of the medieval isorhythmic motet the renaissance composers of the motet generally abandoned the use of a repeated figure as a cantus firmus guillaume dufay was a transitional figure he wrote one of the last motets in the medieval isorhythmic style the nuper rosarum flores which premiered in one four three six and was written to commemorate the completion of filippo brunelleschi s dome in the cathedral of florence during this time however the use of canti firmi in works such as the parody mass tended to stretch the cantus firmus out to great lengths compared to the multivoice descant above it this tended to obscure the rhythm supplied by the cantus firmus that is apparent in the medieval isorhythmic motet the cascading passing chords created by the interplay between multiple voices and the absence of a strong or obvious beat are the features that distinguish medieval and renaissance vocal styles instead the renaissance motet is a short polyphonic musical setting in imitative counterpoint for chorus of a religious text not specifically connected to the liturgy of a given day and therefore suitable for use in any service the texts of antiphons were frequently used as motet texts this is the sort of composition that is most familiarly named by the name of motet and the renaissance period marked the flowering of the form in essence these motets were sacred madrigals the relationship between the two forms is most obvious in the composers who concentrated on sacred music especially giovanni pierluigi da palestrina whose motets setting texts from the canticum canticorum the biblical song of solomon are among the most lush and madrigal like of palestrina s compositions while his madrigals that set poems of petrarch in praise of the blessed virgin mary would not be out of place in church the language of the text was the decisive feature if it s latin it s a motet if the vernacular a madrigal religious compositions in vernacular languages were often called madrigali spirituali spiritual madrigals like most madrigals renaissance motets developed in episodic format with separate phrases of the source text being given independent melodic treatment and contrapuntal development contrapuntal passages often alternate with monody secular motets continued to be written these motets typically set a latin text in praise of a monarch or commemorating some public triumph the themes of courtly love often found in the medieval secular motet were banished from the renaissance motet this was one of the pre eminent forms of renaissance music other important composers of renaissance motets include alexander agricola gilles binchois antoine busnois william byrd johannes vodnianus campanus loyset comp re josquin des prez john dunstable antoine de f vin francisco guerrero nicolas gombert heinrich isaac pierre de la rue orlando di lasso crist bal de morales jean mouton jacob obrecht johannes ockeghem giovanni pierluigi da palestrina thomas tallis john taverner tom s luis de victoria in the latter part of the one six th century giovanni gabrieli and other composers developed a new style the polychoral motet in which two or more choirs of singers or instruments alternated this style of motet was sometimes called the venetian motet to distinguish it from the netherlands or flemish motet written elsewhere baroque motets the name motet was preserved into baroque music especially in france where the word was applied to petits motets sacred choral compositions whose only accompaniment was a basso continuo and grands motets which included instruments up to and including a full orchestra jean baptiste lully was an important composer of this sort of motet lully s motets often included parts for soloists as well as choirs they were longer including multiple movement in which different soloist choral or instrumental forces were employed lully s motets also continued the renaissance tradition of semi secular latin motets in works such as plaude laetare gallia written to celebrate the baptism of king louis xiv s son its text by pierre perrin begins plaude laetare gallia rore caelesti rigantur lilia sacro delphinus fonte lavatur et christianus christo dicatur rejoice and sing france the lily is bathed with heavenly dew the dauphin is bathed in the sacred font and the christian is dedicated to christ in germany too pieces called motets were written in the new musical languages of the baroque heinrich sch tz wrote many motets in a series of publications called symphoniae sacrae some in latin and some in german johann sebastian bach also wrote six surviving works he called motets bach s motets were relatively long pieces in german on sacred themes for choir and basso continuo bach s motets are bwv two two five singet dem herrn ein neues lied one seven two six bwv two two six der geist hilft unser

heiden the motet since bach later one eight th century composers wrote few motets although mozart s well known ave verum corpus is in this genre in the one nine th century german composers continued to write motets occasionally notably johannes brahms in german and anton bruckner in latin french composers of motets included camille saint sa ns and c sar franck similar compositions in the english language are called anthems but some later english composers such as charles villiers stanford wrote motets in latin the majority of these compositions are a cappella but some are accompanied by organ

ambrosius welsh myrddin emrys also known as myrddin wyllt merlin the wild merlin caledonensis scottish merlin merlinus and merlyn is the personage best known as the mighty wizard featured in accounts of king arthur starting with geoffrey of monmouth s historia regum britanniae other accounts describe a far different merlin merlin dictating his poems as illustrated in a french book from the one three th century indeed some texts clearly distinguish two different figures named merlin for example the welsh triads state there were three baptisimal bards taliesin chief of bards myrddin wyllt and myrddin emrys if these two bards called myrddin were originally variants of the same figure their stories have become so different in the earliest texts that we have about them that they are best treated as separate characters even though similar incidents are ascribed to both merlinus caledonensis myrddin wyllt this myrddin had nothing to do with arthur and flourished after the arthurian period the earliest welsh poems that concern the myrddin legend present him as a madman living a wretched existence in the caledonian forest ruminating on his former existence and the disaster that brought him low the death of his lord gwenddolau whom he served as bard the allusions in these poems serve to sketch out the events of the battle of arfderydd where rhydderch hael king of rheged slaughtered the forces of gwenddolau and myrddin went mad watching this defeat the annales cambriae date this battle to ad five seven three and name gwenddolau s adversaries as gwrgi and peredur the sons of eliffer a version of this legend is preserved in a late fifteenth century manuscript in a story called lailoken and kentigern in this narrative st kentigern meets in a deserted place with a naked hairy madman who is called lailoken although said by some to be called merlynum or merlin who declares that he has been condemned for his sins to wander in the company of beasts he added that he had been the cause for the deaths of all of the persons killed in the battle fought on the plain between liddel and carwannok having told his story the madman lept up and fled from the presence of the saint back into the wilderness he appears several times more in the narrative until at last asking st kentigern for the sacrament prophesying that he was about to die a triple death after some hesitation the saint granted the madman s wish and later that day the shepherds of king meldred captured him beat him with clubs then cast him into the river tweed where his body was pierced by a stake thus fulfilling his prophecy welsh literature has many examples of a prophetic literature predicting the military victory of all of the celtic peoples of britain who will join together and drive the english and later the normans also back into the sea some of these works were claimed to be the prophecies of myrddin some of it was not as for example the armes prydein this wild prophetic merlin was also treated by geoffrey of monmouth in his vita merlini which looks like a close adaptation of a number of myrddin poems a scottish example of the legend of merlin comes from five seven seven which was the year of the battle of arderyth this was a battle between fierce enemies rydderych the bountiful king of strathclyde and aeddam the perfidious king of kintyre while few have heard of the main protagonists among aidan s contingent was the celtic bard merlin merlin s patron gwenddolan was killed during the battle in which he was awarded for his verses recording the battle merlin ambrosius myrddin emrys it was geoffrey of monmouth who introduced merlin into the myths of king arthur the name myrddin is altered to merlin to avoid a resemblance to the obscene french word merde meaning excrement while geoffrey is remembered most for his character of arthur it was merlin whom he concentrated on making the prophetic bard a central character of his three books prophetiae merlini historiae regum britanniae and vita merlini as a result of this second book where merlin appears in the tales of the king vortigern aurelius ambrosius and uther pendragon who reigned immediately before arthur merlin in some later works also became a character in tales of arthur geoffrey tells only two tales of merlin merlin is begotten on a king s daughter by a demon and the episode is now placed at carmarthen in welsh caer myrddin as a young boy he was already known for his prophetic abilities and was consulted by king vortigern to explain why his castle would collapse every time it was rebuilt he revealed there was an underground lake with two sleeping dragons a white one and red one and explained they respectively represented the saxons and britons and portent for things to come nennius had recorded this tale in the historia britonum of the nine th century but attached it to aurelius ambrosius rather than merlin geoffrey conflated the two sages and incorporated them into his work simply and baldly stating that merlin was also called ambrosius to cover over his changing of nennius a long section of prophecy is added at this point the first tale tells how merlin created stonehenge as a burial place for aurelius ambrosius the second tale tells how by shape changing magic merlin enabled uther pendragon to enter into tintagel in disguise and father his son arthur these episodes also appear in many later adaptations of geoffrey s account somewhat later the poet robert de boron retold this material in his poem merlin with many expansions but with details garbled and changed in a way that suggests that the version of wace who adapted geoffrey s account into anglo norman had entered oral tradition and that this oral tradition was what robert knew along with some other merlin tales only a few lines of the poem have survived but a prose retelling became popular and was later incorporated into two other romances in robert s account merlin is begotten by a devil from hell on a virgin as an intended antichrist but his expectant mother advised by her confessor and counsellor blaise who realised what was amiss had the boy baptized at birth to foil this satanic plot however being half demon merlin still had tremendous magical powers to know what was happening past and present and god himself gave him prophetic knowledge of the future robert de boron lays great emphasis on merlin s power to change his shape on his joking personality and on his connection to the grail this text introduces merlin s master blaise who is pictured as writing merlin s deeds which merlin dictates to him explaining how they came to be known and preserved it also connects merlin with the holy grail as the arthurian mythos was retold and embellished upon merlin s prophetic aspects were sometimes de emphasized in favor of portraying merlin as a wizard and elder advisor to arthur on the other hand in prose lancelot it is said that merlin was never baptized and never did any good in his life only evil medieval arthurian tales abound in inconsistencies in the prose lancelot and later accounts merlin s eventual downfall came from his lusting after a woman named nimue who coaxed his magical secrets from him eventually turning the magic he had taught her against him and imprisoning him either in a cave where he died or in a magical and invisible palace where he may live still this was unfortunate for arthur depriving him of merlin s counsel there are three such accounts of merlin in arthur s day which also cover the early days of arthur s reign the earliest known as the vulgate merlin includes robert de boron s merlin it was intended as a sort of prequel to the three romances of the lancelot grail cycle an incomplete variant version known as the book of arthur also exists the second is sometimes called the huth merlin or the post vulgate suite du merlin it is part of a long prose romance that has not survived intact but which is now known as the book of the grail or the post vulgate cycle intended as an entire history of the grail and of arthur and his knights this also includes robert de boron s merlin the third work is called the prophecies of merlin and contains long prophecies of merlin mostly concerned with thirteenth century italian politics some by his ghost after his death the prophecies are interspersed with episodes relating merlin s deeds and with various arthurian adventures in which merlin does not appear at all later fiction about merlin novels and plays many of the novels in the article king arthur

dealing in commodities that they do not produce themselves in order to produce profit merchants can be categorised into two types a wholesale merchant operates in the chain between producer and retail merchant some wholesale merchants only organise the movement of goods rather than move the goods themselves a retail merchant sells commodities to consumers including businesses commonly known as retailers a shop owner is a retail merchant a merchant class characterises many pre modern societies its status can range from high even achieving titles like that of merchant prince or nabob to low such as in chinese culture due to the soiling capabilities of profiting from mere trade rather than from the labour of others reflected in agricultural produce and tribute under the common law and the uniform commercial code in the united states merchants are held to a higher standard in the selling of products than those who are not engaged in the sale of goods as a profession for example when a merchant sells something he or she is deemed to give an implied warranty of merchantability guaranteeing that the product is fit to be sold even if there is nothing in writing to this effect see also

earth s or another body s atmosphere commonly called a shooting star or falling star for bodies with a size scale larger than the atmospheric mean free path one zero cm to several meters the visibility is due to the heat produced by the ram pressure not friction as is commonly assumed of atmospheric entry since the majority of meteors are from small sand grain size meteoroid bodies most visible signatures are caused by dexcitation following the individual collisions between vaporized meteor atoms and atmospheric constituents a very bright meteor may be called a fireball or bolide the international meteor organisation defines fireballs as being meteors of magnitude three or brighter the meteor section of the british astronomical association on the other hand has a much stricter definition requiring the meteor to be magnitude five or brighter if a meteoroid survives its transit of the atmosphere to come to rest on the surface the resulting object is called a meteorite a meteor striking the earth or other object may produce an impact crater molten terrestrial material splashed from such a crater can cool and solidify into an object known as a tektite meteor dust particles left by falling meteoroids can persist in the atmosphere for up to several months these particles might affect climate both by scattering electromagnetic radiation and by catalyzing chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere ionization trails during the entry of a meteoroid into the upper atmosphere an ionization trail is created where the molecules in the upper atmosphere are ionized by the passage of the meteor such ionization trails can last up to four five minutes at a time small sand grain sized meteoroids are entering the atmosphere constantly essentially every few seconds in a given region and thus ionization trails can be found in the upper atmosphere more or less continuously when radio waves are bounced off these trails it is called meteor scatter communication meteor scatter has been used for experimental secure military battlefield communications systems the basic idea of such a system is that such an ion trail will act as a mirror for radio waves which can be bounced off the trail security arises from the fact that as a mirror only receivers in the correct position will hear the transmitter much as with a real mirror what is seen in reflection depends upon one s position with respect to the mirror because the sporadic nature of meteor entry such systems are limited to low data rates typically four five nine six zero zero baud amateur radio operators sometimes use meteor scatter communication on vhf bands snowpack information from the sierra nevada mountains in california is transmitted from remote sites via meteor scatter meteor radars can measure atmospheric density and winds by measuring the decay rate and doppler shift of a meteor trail large meteoroids can leave behind very large ionization trails which then interact with the earth s magnetic field as the trail dissipates megawatts of electromagnetic energy can be released with a peak in the power spectrum at audio frequencies curiously although the waves are electromagnetic

in encino california is a prominent american financier who almost single handedly created the present day market for high yield or junk bonds during the one nine seven zero s after he was sent to prison on finance related charges he became the epitome of wall street greed during the one nine eight zero s and was nicknamed the junk bond king after serving his sentence milken launched a public relations campaign to highlight his role as a great innovator and financier particularly with regard to popularizing higher risk alternative investments while smoothing over his criminal record he has also devoted much time and money to charity leading some observers to accuse him of trying to buy back his good name though his supporters point out that his philanthropy goes back to the one nine seven zero s long before any controversy a summa cum laude graduate of the university of california at berkeley where he was elected a member of phi beta kappa milken received his master s degree in business administration from the university of pennsylvania s wharton school work on wall street in january one nine six nine he went to work for drexel harriman ripley as assistant to the chairman when drexel merged with burnham and company in one nine seven three milken headed the non investment grade bond department an operation that earned a remarkable one zero zero return on investment by one nine seven six milken s income was estimated at five million a year in one nine seven eight milken returned to his home state of california during the one nine eight zero s he became known as a controversial financial innovator whose work at investment bank drexel burnham lambert inc greatly expanded the use of high yield debt junk bonds in corporate finance and mergers and acquisitions which fueled the one nine eight zero s leveraged buyout boom through his business acumen the network of contacts and clients and the trust he had earned from buy side investors buyers of primary market debt issues as well as milken s issuance of the highly confident letter he had the ability to raise tremendous amounts of money he was a big contributor to the success of drexel that largely due to milken went from one two million in fees to over four billion in one nine eight six making it the most profitable firm on wall street at the time in june one nine eight nine milken resigned from drexel to form his own company international capital access group this new venture was supposed to help workers and companies in building businesses while he is best known for his successful financing through high yield bonds he also employed equity based securities hybrids and scores of other financial instruments in more than a dozen asset classes to help clients grow legal charges in one nine eight nine rudy giuliani the united states attorney for the southern district of new york charged him under the rico act with nine eight counts of racketeering and fraud and he was indicted by a federal grand jury after a plea bargain milken pled guilty to six lesser securities and reporting violations he paid a two zero zero million fine and another four zero zero million in settlements relating primarily to civil lawsuits he was banned for life from the securities industry judge kimba wood at milken s sentencing told him you were willing to commit only crimes that were unlikely to be detected when a man of your power in the financial world repeatedly conspires to violate and violates securities and tax business in order to achieve more power and wealth for himself a significant prison term is required wood recommended a one zero year prison sentence of which in her opinion milken should have served at least three six to four zero months however milken served only about two two months from march one nine nine one to january one nine nine three before being released upon his release it is estimated he still had about seven zero zero million of his personal fortune intact he has since entered numerous other business ventures in one nine nine eight without admitting any guilt he returned four seven million in fees to settle another sec lawsuit relating to the one nine nine one order barring him from the securities industry which he allegedly overstepped when he advised mci news corporation in a one nine nine five deal for which he received two seven million and when he advised revlon chairman ronald perelman on a revlon new world communications deal in one nine nine six for which he received one five million in the same year time warner acquired turner broadcasting for which milken received five zero million in advisory fees that deal was not brought up in the court guilty pleas milken planned or thought to engage in a series of unlawful security transactions charge involving tax fraud the charge relates to ivan boesky s false one three d statement milken suggested that ivan boesky buy mca stock to hide that golden nugget was selling and to assure him no loss in a sale to drexel helped a client reduce his income tax liability by selling him two investments and then buying them back at a lower price failed to disclose in written form an agreed upon adjustment in transaction prices between drexel and a client after prison term upon his release milken resumed his philanthropic activities keeping the focus on education and medical research he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in the same month he was released from prison january one nine nine three assessments of milken s accomplishments judgments of milken s accomplishments namely whether they were good for the u s economy or if they were ethical tend to depend on the ideology of the observer and usually fall within two groups milken s supporters tend to be libertarian including bank of sweden prize winning economist milton friedman generally speaking this group argues as friedman did in his one nine seven one article does business have social responsibility that no special moral obligations apply to businessmen and since milken s actions by and large were legal at the time he did nothing wrong generally speaking they argue junk bonds were a brilliant innovation and even today occupy a large part of most investment portfolios there was a large market for junk bonds after savings and loan banks were deregulated milken was made into a scapegoat for the savings and loans scandal ambitious government officials such as rudy giuliani practically forced him to plead guilty although some supporters continue to maintain he was completely innocent on the other hand individuals who believe businessmen should adhere to higher moral standards such as financier warren buffett or former salomon brothers bond salesman michael lewis condemn many of milken s actions while they acknowledge his useful financial innovations they generally argue that junk bonds are a high risk investment risk averse investors should only allocate a portion of a well diversified portfolio to them milken artificially tampered with the economic laws of supply and demand when the demand for junk bonds exceeded the supply he created more fallen angels by promoting corporate raids that reduced the credit ratings of otherwise sound companies into junk status he improperly induced insurance companies to purchase his junk bonds in vast quantities and when the artificially inflated junk bond market collapsed this left policyholders including employees of many companies who had replaced their pension systems with annuities purchased from the corrupted insurance companies holding worthless paper he compensated himself out of proportion to his work while not the sole cause he nonetheless contributed to the collapse of america s savings corporate raids that often allowed smaller companies executives and financiers to acquire older and more established companies depending on ideology this was seen as a good thing or a bad thing while such practices arguably improved efficiency at these companies they also caused unemployment charitable and public relations work milken has used his personal fortune and high level contacts to become an influential voice in economics education and medical research business leaders including ted turner and news corp s rupert murdoch are today counted amongst his supporters directors of his nonprofit foundations include former intel corp chairman andrew grove and retired u s army general norman schwarzkopf in one nine eight two he co founded the milken family foundation to support medical research and education in one nine nine one he founded the milken institute in one nine nine three he founded the prostate cancer foundation the world s largest philanthropic source of funds for prostate cancer research in two zero zero three he launched the washington d c based think tank fastercures which seeks greater efficiency in researching all serious diseases the milken family foundation founded the milken national educator awards in

fictional profession or discipline in frank herbert s dune universe following the butlerian jihad in the dune universe s back story it was forbidden to create man like machines thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of the human mind rayna butler as told to her by the spirit of saint serena thinking machines were outlawed throughout the universe and the mentat discipline was developed as a replacement mentats are humans trained to be able to mimic computers human minds developed to staggering heights of cognitive and analytical ability ironically the first mentat was selected by a thinking machine gilbertus albans selected from the corrin slave pens about one two zero b g by the independent robot erasmus displayed the first cognitive thinking and computer like calculation capacity necessary for a mentat unlike computers however mentats are not simply human calculators writ large instead the exceptional cognitive abilities of memory and perception are the foundations for supra logical hypothesizing mentats are able to sift large volumes of data and devise concise analyses in a process that goes far beyond logical deduction mentats cultivate the na ve mind the mind without preconception or prejudice that can extract the essential patterns or logic of data and deliver with varying degrees of certainty useful conclusions they are not limited to formulating syllogisms they are the supreme counselors of the dune universe filling roles as menial as archivists and clerks or as grand as advisor to the emperor the ability to be a mentat is a talent limited to a small number of people thus those with the discipline are prized in whatever role they choose there are also varying degrees of ability in dune thufir hawat is considered to be one of the best mentats known at the time a mentat s capabilities can be greatly increased by taking sapho juice but using it leads to addiction sapho is extracted from the root of the ecaz tree and its use doubles or even triples the mentat s immense processing power however repeated use turns the user s lips a shade of red being a mentat can be a profession in itself or the discipline can be added to other roles in dune paul atreides is a mentat duke later emperor in heretics of dune and chapterhouse dune miles teg is a mentat bashar or general who is the most formidable military commander in the known universe it s also possible to vary the discipline in dune the tleilaxu create twisted mentats for the baron vladimir harkonnen piter de vries being the most notable example the purpose of which is a sociopathic mentat free from the usual constraints of human morality or instinctual considerations de vries is among other things a sadist and acts as torturer for the baron in dune messiah duncan idaho is recreated as a ghola and trained as both a mentat and as a zensunni philosopher he then serves paul atreides as the house weapons master in children of dune he marries the regent alia but is then instrumental in protecting the royal heirs from her demonstrating that mentats are rarely simply disinterested observers and counselors in god emperor of dune leto outlaws the order and crushes any renegade training schools he finds unlike his father s execution of historians for the purpose of controlling his legacy and symbolism leto never explicitly mentions why he suppresses mentats leaving the reader to conclude that it simply plays a role in his larger purpose of oppressing humanity in order to create his golden path the art is not eliminated however surviving through underground schools notably the bene gesserit preserve the art assuming that leto knows of this through his prescience and approves the robot erasmus as well as the characters serena butler and reyna butler are inventions of brian herbert and not the original author of dune frank herbert gilbertus albans was the first mentat but the method by which he became one was never explained the mentat mantra the david lynch dune movie includes a scene in which piter de vries recites the following upon drinking sapho juice it is by will alone i set my mind in motion it is by the juice of sapho that thoughts acquire speed the lips acquire stains the stains become a warning it is by will alone i set my mind in motion this mantra is a creation of lynch and does not appear in the books though in the first book there is mention that thufir hawat has cranberry stained lips due to sapho juice but because he is the only one about whom this remark is made it is quite possible that it was a personal habit of hawat to drink the sapho juice and not a general essential practice of mentats unofficially called the mentat mantra by fans it is often parodied to refer to real life substance addictions most notably caffeine correction all mentats drink sapho juice not just thufir hawat dune mayerling is a hunting lodge in lower austria where on january three zero one eight eight nine archduke crown prince rudolf of austria only son of emperor franz joseph and elisabeth and heir to the austro hungarian crown was found dead with his mistress baroness mary vetsera apparently as a result of suicide the suicide theory is not far fetched given the long line of outbreaks of mental instability in the habsburg dynasty caused by their long history of inbreeding rudolf s uncle the archduke viktor ludwig spent most of his life exiled on the island of capri following a series of scandals involving dressing up in women s clothes and molesting his military aides his mother elisabeth was cousin of mad king ludwig of bavaria conspiracy theories it was claimed by among others empress zita widow of the last emperor karl r one nine one six one nine one eight that the crown prince was killed either at the behest of austrian security officials for his suspected pro hungarian sympathies or by french agents he was close to georges clemenceau because he refused to participate in the deposition of his pro german father emperor franz josef no evidence has been discovered to prove either of these theories though an examination of the remains of marie vetsera which had been stolen in the early one nine nine zero s and on rediscovery were checked to ensure they were the correct remains contradicted the official reports that she had been shot her skull showed no evidence of bullet wounds or shrapnel instead the evidence was that she had been beaten to death a resulting re examination of files about the death of the crown prince revealed major discrepancies between the claimed manner of the deaths and the factual evidence including that rudolf had engaged in a violent struggle prior to his death that the gun that caused his death was not his and that six shots were fired from the gun how someone who had reportedly died instantly from the first shot managed to fire the remaining five bullets remains a mystery while the official statement of how the deaths occurred and its central theory of a double suicide is now discredited it remains unclear whether rudolf in fact battered his mistress to death before killing himself and if he did how he managed to shoot six bullets when the first would have instantly caused his death also open to suggestion is that both were killed by a third party no other source material is available to establish just what did happen empress zita who was the last surviving confidante of emperor franz josef and may have been able to shed some light on the private opinions of the members of the habsburg family and their advisors died in one nine

keyboards on musical instruments for instruments referred to as keyboards see keyboard instrument the layout of a typical musical keyboard a musical keyboard is the set of adjacent depressible levers on a musical instrument which cause the instrument to produce sounds keyboards almost all share the common layout shown musical instruments with keyboards of this type include the piano harpsichord clavichord organ synthesizer or electric keyboard celesta accordion melodica glasschord and carillon since the most commonly encountered keyboard instrument is the piano the keyboard layout is often called the piano keyboard in spite of this keyboard instruments of different types are often played using different techniques in particular the electric keyboard uses pre set drum rhythms which respond to chords played in the left hand by the instrumentalist with other buttons and switches used to change rhythms and even the voice of the instrument in some european countries such a keyboard is called a hoxophone the twelve notes of the western musical scale are laid out with the lowest note on the left the larger keys for the seven natural notes of the c major scale c d e f g a b jut forward because these keys are often coloured white on a keyboard these are often called the white notes or white keys the keys for the remaining five notes which are not part of the c major scale namely c d d e f g g a a b are set back because these keys are often coloured black these notes are often called the black notes or black keys the pattern repeats at the interval of an octave the arrangement of longer keys for c major with intervening shorter keys for the intermediate semitones dates to the one five th century many keyboard instruments dating from before the nineteenth century have a keyboard with the colours of the keys reversed darker coloured keys for the white notes and white keys for the black notes a roland exr three keyboard the chromatic compass of keyboard instruments has tended to increase harpsichords often extended over five octaves in the one eight th century while most pianos manufactured since about one eight seven zero have eight eight keys some modern pianos have even more notes a b sendorfer two two five has nine two and a b sendorfer two nine zero imperial has nine seven keys modern synthesizer keyboards commonly have either six one seven six or eight eight keys organs normally have six one keys per manual though some spinet models have four four or four nine an organ pedalboard a keyboard played by the organist s feet may vary in size from one two to three two notes piano keyboard which shows the alignment of the white and the black keys in a well designed keyboard the natural keys are of uniform width at the front and all keys are uniformly distributed if the width of an octave is taken to be one two units then the white key width is one two seven units and the centre of each of the twelve keys must be separated by one unit there have been variations in the design of the keyboard to address technical and musical issues for instance during the sixteenth century when instruments were often tuned in meantone temperament some harpsichords were constructed with the g and e keys split into two one portion of the g key operated a string tuned to g and the other operated a string tuned to a similarly one portion of the e key operated a string tuned to e the other portion operating a string tuned to d this extended the flexibility of the harpsichord enabling composers to write keyboard music calling for harmonies containing the so called wolf fifth e to g but without producing discomfort in the listeners other examples of variations in keyboard design include the janko keyboard and the chromatic keyboard systems on the accordion and bandone n other instruments share the keyboard layout although they are not keyboard instruments for example the xylophone marimba vibraphone and glockenspiel all have a separate sounding tone bar for each note and these bars are laid out in the same configuration as a common keyboard references external links keyboard magazine features selections from magazine along

is about musical systems of tuning for the musical process of tuning see tuning musical tuning is the system used to define which tones or pitches to use when playing music in other words it is the choice of number and spacing of frequency values which are used the tuning systems are usually defined in such a way that a listener perceives it as natural due to the psychoacoustic properties of tones various pitch combinations will sound more or less natural when used in combination for example a tone caused by a vibration twice the speed of another the ratio of one two forms the natural sounding octave another natural resonance found in musical scales the world over is the ratio of one three two three when octave reduced which is often called a perfect fifth more complex musical effects can be created through other relationships mathieu one nine nine seven building a tuning system is complicated when musicians want to make music with more than just a few differing tones as the number of tones is increased conflicts arise in how each tone combines with every other finding a successful combination of tunings has been the cause of debate and has lead to the creation of many different tuning systems across the world each tuning system has its own characteristics strengths and weaknesses subjects in general musical theory mathematics of musical scales other musical tunings chinese indian etc microtonal music psychoacoustics physics of music midi ways of tuning the twelve note chromatic scale it is impossible to tune the twelve note chromatic scale so that all intervals are perfect many different methods with their own various compromises have thus been put forward the main ones are just intonation in which the ratios of the frequencies between all notes are based on relatively low whole numbers such as three two five four or seven four or in which all pitches are based on the harmonic series music which are all whole number multiples of a single tone such a system may use two different ratios for what is the same interval in equal temperament depending on context for instance a major second may be either in the ratio nine eight or one zero nine for this reason just intonation may be less a suitable system for use on keyboard instruments or other instruments where the pitch of individual notes is not flexible on fretted instruments like guitars and lutes multiple frets for one interval is practical pythagorean tuning in which the ratios of the frequencies between all notes are all multiples of three two the pythagorean system was further developed by safi ad din al urmawi who divided the octave into seventeen parts limmas and commas and used in the turkish and persian tone systems meantone temperament a system of tuning which averages out pairs of ratios used for the same interval such as nine eight and one zero nine thus making it possible to tune keyboard instruments next to the twelve equal temperament which some would not regard as a form of meantone the best known form of this temperament is quarter comma meantone which tunes major thirds justly in the ratio of five four and divides them into two whole tones of equal size to do this eleven perfect fifths in each octave are flattened by a quarter of a syntonic comma with the remaining fifth being left very sharp such an unacceptably out of tune fifth is known as a wolf interval however the fifth may be flattened to a greater or lesser degree than this and the tuning system will retain the essential qualities of meantone temperament examples include the three one equal fifth and lucy tuning both just intonation and meantone temperament can be regarded as forms of regular temperament well temperament any one of a number of systems where the ratios between intervals are unequal but approximate to ratios used in just intonation unlike meantone temperament the amount of divergence from just ratios varies according to the exact notes being tuned so that c e will probably be tuned closer to a five four ratio than say db f because of this well temperaments have no wolf intervals a well temperament system is usually named after whoever first came up with it equal temperament a special case of well temperament in which adjacent notes of the scale are all separated by logarithmically equal distances one zero zero cents ogg format nine six nine kb since this scale divides an octave into twelve equal ratio steps the frequency ratio between adjacent notes is then the twelfth root of two two one one two or one zero five nine four six three zero

american composer who wrote musical and dramatic works in just intonation xenharmonic bohlen pierce scale lucytuning a microtuning system created by charles lucy devised from pi and the writings of john longitude harrison designed to emulate eastern tuning systems as well as western alpha and beta scales of wendy carlos quarter tone scale first presented by mikha il mishaqah used in the theory of arab music tone systems from this the heptatonic scales consisting of minor neutral and major seconds of maqamat are chosen this system was first promoted by al farabi using a two five tone scale stretched tuning makes an octave represent slightly more than a doubling in frequency it is usually applied to keyboard instruments with tines or thick strings where the ratio of harmonic to fundamental can be slightly greater than a true integer ratio typically piano and electric piano stretched tuning is sometimes claimed to give a warmer sound to chords comparisons and controversies between tunings all musical tuning have advantages and disadvantages twelve tone equal temperament is the standard and most usual tuning system used in western music today because it gives the advantage of modulation to any key without dramatically going out of tune as all keys are equally and slightly out of tune however just intonation provides the advantage of being entirely in tune with at least some and possible a great deal loss in ease of modulation referring to one two tet the composer terry riley who has written music for both tuning systems has been quoted as saying western music is fast because it s not in tune twelve tone equal temperament also currently has an advantage over just intonation in that most musicians will have instruments that can only play in equal temperament since these are readily available other tuning systems have other advantages and disadvantages and are chosen for these qualities it must be realized however that just as many people who play music today in equal temperament without having heard of it many musicians throughout the world and the past used just intonation without knowing it the octave or even other intervals such as the so called tritave or twelfth can advantageously be divided into a number of equal steps different from twelve popular choices for such an equal temperament include one nine two two three one five three and seven two parts to an octave each of these and the many other choices possible have their own distinct characteristics non equal and non just tunings also provide advantages for instance william sethares shows that the tunings of balinese gamelans are related to the inharmonic spectra or timbre of their metallophones and the harmonic spectra of stringed instruments such as the rebab just as just intonation and twelve tone equal temperament are related to the spectra or timbre of harmonic instruments alone some instruments such as the violin don t limit the musician to particular pitches allowing to choose the tuning system on the fly many performers on such instruments adjust the notes to be more in tune than the equal temperament system allows perhaps even without realizing

blocks of life the miller urey experiment or urey miller experiment was an experiment that simulated hypothetical conditions present on the early earth and tested for the occurrence of chemical evolution the oparin and haldane hypothesis stated that conditions on the primitive earth favored chemical reactions that synthesized organic compounds from inorganic precursors the miller urey tested this hypothesis the experiment is considered to be the classic experiment on the origin of life it was conducted in one nine five three by stanley l miller and harold c urey at the university of chicago experiment and interpretation the experiment the experiment used water h two o methane ch four ammonia nh three and hydrogen h two the chemicals were all sealed inside a sterile array of glass tubes and flasks connected together in a loop with one flask half full of liquid water and another flask containing a pair of electrodes the liquid water was heated to induce evaporation sparks were fired through the atmosphere and water vapor to simulate lightning and then the atmosphere was cooled again so that the water could condense and trickle back into the first flask in a continuous cycle at the end of one week of continuous operation miller and urey observed that as much as one zero one five of the carbon within the system was now in the form of organic compounds two percent of the carbon had formed amino acids including one three of the two one that are used to make proteins in living cells with glycine as the most abundant however there are two forms of amino acids they are referred to as a left handed or a right handed amino acids only left handed amino acids are found in living organisms and the ones created in the miller urey experiment and all subsequent experiments succeed in creating right and left handed amino acids in roughly a five zero five zero ratio the molecules produced were simple organic molecules far from a complete living biochemical system but the experiment established that the hypothetical processes could produce some building blocks of life without requiring life to synthesize them first other experiments this experiment inspired many experiments in a similar vein in one nine six one joan or found that amino acids could be made from hydrogen cyanide hcn and ammonia in a water solution he also found that his experiment produced a large amount of the nucleotide base adenine experiments conducted later showed that the other rna and dna bases could be obtained through simulated prebiotic chemistry with a reducing atmosphere earth s early atmosphere there have been a number of objections to the implications derived from these experiments it is now believed that earth s original atmosphere did not contain as large a quantity of reducing molecules as was thought at the time originally it was thought that the primitive secondary atmosphere contained mostly nh three and ch four however it is likely that most of the atmospheric carbon was co two with perhaps some co and the nitrogen mostly n two the reasons for this are a volcanic gas has more co two co and n two than ch four and nh three and b uv radiation destroys nh three and ch four so that these molecules would have been short lived uv light photolyses h two o to h and oh radicals these then attack methane giving eventually co two and releasing h two which would be lost into space in practice gas mixtures containing co co two n two etc give much the same products as those containing ch four and nh three so long as there is no o two the h atoms come mostly from water vapor in fact in order to generate aromatic amino acids under primitive earth conditions it is necessary to use less hydrogen rich gaseous mixtures most of the natural amino acids hydroxyacids purines pyrimidines and sugars have been produced in variants of the miller experiment more recent results may have called this into question however simulations done at the university of waterloo and university of colorado in two zero zero five indicated that the early atmosphere of earth could have contained up to four zero hydrogen implying a much more hospitable environment for the formation of prebiotic organic molecules the escape of hydrogen from earth s atmosphere into space may have occurred at only one of the rate previously believed based on revised estimates of the upper atmosphere s temperature one of the authors prof owen toon notes in this new scenario organics can be produced efficiently in the early atmosphere leading us back to the organic rich soup in the ocean concept i

complement the waterloo colorado results in re establishing the importance of the miller urey experiment although lightning storms are thought to have been very common in the primordial atmosphere they are not thought to have been as common as the amount of electricity used by the miller urey experiment may imply these factors suggest that much lower concentrations of biochemicals would have been produced on earth than was originally predicted although the time scale would be one zero zero million years instead of a week similar experiments both with different sources of energy and with different mixtures of gases have resulted in amino and hydroxy acids being produced it is likely that at least some organic compounds would have been generated on the early earth however as soon as oxygen gas is added to the mixture no organic molecules are formed recent research has been seized upon by opponents of urey miller hypothesis which shows the presence of uranium in sediments dated to three seven ga and indicates it was transported in solution by oxygenated water otherwise it would have precipitated out rosing in fact most evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis was present during time periods from which there is evidence for a non oxygenic atmosphere conditions similar to those of the miller urey experiments are present in other regions of the solar system often substituting ultraviolet light for lightning as the driving force for chemical reactions on september two eight one nine six nine the murchison meteorite that fell near murchison victoria australia was found to contain over nine zero different amino acids nineteen of which are found in earth life comets and other icy outer solar system bodies are thought to contain large amounts of complex carbon compounds such as tholins formed by these processes in some cases so much so that the surfaces of these bodies are turned dark red or as black as asphalt the early earth was bombarded heavily by comets possibly providing a large supply of complex organic molecules along with the water and other volatiles they contributed this could also imply an origin of life outside of earth which then migrated here see panspermia recent related studies during recent years studies have been made of the amino acid composition of the products of old areas in old genes defined as those that are found to be common to organisms from several widely separated species assumed to share only the last universal ancestor lua of all extant species these studies found that the products of these areas are enriched in those amino acids that are also most readily produced in the miller urey experiment this suggests that the original genetic code was based on a smaller number of amino acids only those

mithras cape mithraism in persian was an ancient mystery religion prominent from the one st century bc to the five th century ad it was based on worship of the god mithras and derives from the persian and indic god mithra and other zoroastrian deities mithras was known throughout europe and asia by the names mithra mitra meitros mihr mehr and meher the veneration of this god began about four zero zero zero years ago in persia where it was soon embedded with babylonian doctrines mithraism apparently originated in the eastern mediterranean around the first or second centuries bc it was practiced in the roman empire since the first century bc and reached its apogee around the third through fourth centuries ad when it was very popular among the roman soldiers mithraism disappeared from overt practice after the theodosian decree of ad three nine one banned all pagan rites and it apparently became extinct thereafter principles of mithraism romans encountered worship of the deity mithras as part of zoroastrianism in the eastern provinces of the empire particularly in asia minor now modern turkey mithraism is best documented in the form it had acquired in the later roman empire it was an initiatory mystery religion passed from initiate to initiate like the eleusinian mysteries it was not based on a supernaturally revealed body of scripture and hence very little written documentary evidence survives soldiers appeared to be the most plentiful followers of mithraism and women were apparently not allowed to join the mithraeum it is difficult for scholars to reconstruct the daily workings and beliefs of mithraism as the rituals were highly secret and limited to initiated men mithras was little more than a name until the massive documentation of franz cumont s texts and illustrated monuments relating to the mysteries of mithra was published in one eight nine four one nine zero zero with the first english translation in one nine zero three however it is known that the center of the cult was the mithraeum either an adapted natural cave or cavern preferably sanctified by previous local religious usage or an artificial building imitating a cavern mithraea were dark and windowless even if they were not actually in a subterranean space or in a natural cave when possible the mithraeum was constructed within or below an existing building the site of a mithraeum may also be identified by its separate entrance or vestibule its cave called the spelaeum or spelunca with raised benches along the side walls for the ritual meal and its sanctuary at the far end often in a recess before which the pedestal like altar stood many mithraea that follow this basic plan are scattered over much of the empire s former area particularly where the legions were stationed along the frontiers others may be recognized by their characteristic layout even though converted as crypts beneath christian churches in every mithraic temple the place of honor was occupied by a representation of mithras killing a sacred bull called a tauroctony it has been more recently proposed that the tauroctony is a symbolic representation of the constellations rather than an originally iranian animal sacrifice scene ulansey one nine nine one mithras is associated with perseus whose constellation is above that of the bull a serpent a scorpion a dog and a raven are present also thought to represent associated constellations from the structure of the mithraea it is possible to surmise that worshippers would have gathered for a common meal along the reclining couches lining the walls it is worth noting that most temples could hold only thirty or forty individuals the mithraeum itself was arranged so as to be an image of the universe members of the cult are thought to have moved about the mithraeum in imitation of the sun and constellations through the universe it is noticed by some researchers that this movement especially in the context of mithraic soterism seems to stem from the neoplatonic concept that the running of the sun from solstic to solstice is a parallel for the movement of the soul through the universe from pre existence into the body and then beyond the physical body into an afterlife also thought to take place in the mithraeum and revealed by the relief on a cup from mainz is the mithraic initiation in this act as depicted on the cup the initiate would be lead into a location where the cult s pater would be seated in the guise of mithras with a drawn bow accompanying the initiate is a mystagogue who explains the symbology and theology to the initiate the rite is thought to re enact what has come to be called the water miracle in which mithras fires a bolt into a rock and from the rock now spouts water beck r two zero zero zero ritual myth doctrine and initiation in the mysteries of mithras new evidence from a cult vessel the journal of roman studies nine zero pp one four five one eight zero mithraic ranks the members of a mithraeum were divided into seven ranks all members were apparently expected to progress through the first four ranks while only a few would go on to the three higher ranks the first four ranks seem to represent spiritual progress while the other three appear to have been specialized offices the seven ranks were corax raven nymphus bridegroom miles soldier leo lion perses persian heliodromus sun courier pater father the new initiate became a corax while the leo was an adept the titles of the first four ranks suggest the possibility that advancement through the ranks was based on introspection and spiritual growth the iconography of mithraism in the absence of any mithraist scripture all we know about mithras is what can be deduced from his images in the mithraea that have survived a statue of the tauroctony in the vatican museum note that mithras is looking toward the bull instead of away a stance rarely seen the tauroctony some depictions show mithras carrying a rock on his back much as atlas did and or wearing a cape that had the starry sky as its inside lining a bronze image of mithras emerging from an egg shaped zodiac ring found associated with a mithraeum along hadrian s wall now at the university of newcastle and an inscription from the city of rome suggest that mithras may have been seen as the orphic creator god phanes who emerged from the cosmic egg at the beginning of time bringing the universe into existence this view is reinforced by a bas relief at the estense museum in modena italy which shows phanes coming from an egg surrounded by the twelve signs of the zodiac in an image very similar to that at newcastle he is sometimes depicted as a man being born or reborn from a rock the petra genetrix typically with the snake oroboros wrapped around it it is commonly believed that the cave in mithraism imagery represents the cosmos and the rock is the cosmos seen from the outside hence the description of this god as rising from the dead according to some accounts mithras died was buried in a cavernous rock tomb and was resurrected another more widely accepted interpretation takes its clue from the writer porphyry who recorded that the cave pictured in the tauroctony was intended to be an image of the cosmos according to this view the cave depicted in that image may represent the great cave of the sky this interpretation was supported by research by k b stark in one eight six nine with astronomical support by roger beck one nine eight four and one nine eight eight david ulansey one nine eight nine and noel swerdlow one nine nine one this interpretation is reinforced by the constant presence in mithraic imagery of heavenly objects such as stars the moon and the sun and symbols for the signs of the zodiac one of the central motifs of mithraism is the tauroctony the myth of sacrifice by mithra of a sacred bull created by the supreme deity ahura mazda which mithra stabs to death in the cave having been instructed to do so by a crow sent from ahura mazda in this myth from the body of the dying bull spring plants animals and all the beneficial things of the earth it is thought that the bull represents the constellation of taurus however in the period we are considering the sun at the vernal equinox had left taurus two thousand years before and was in the process of moving from aries to pisces in light of this interpretation it has been suggested in recent times that the mithraic religion is somehow connected to the end of the astrological age of taurus and the beginning of the age of aries which took place about the year two zero zero zero bc it has even been speculated that the religion may have originated at that time although there is no record of it until the two nd century bc the identification of an age with a particular zodiac constellation is based on the sun s position during the vernal equinox before two zero zero zero bc the sun could have been seen against the stars of the constellation of taurus at the time of vernal equinox had there been an eclipse due to the precession of the equinoxes on average every two one six zero years the sun appears against the stars of a new constellation at vernal equinox the current astrological age started when the equinox precessed into the constellation of pisces in about the year one five zero bc with the age of aquarius starting in ad two six zero zero indeed the constellations common in the sky from about four zero zero zero bc to two zero zero zero bc were taurus the bull canis minor the dog hydra the snake corvus the raven and scorpio the scorpion all of which may be identified in the fresco from marino a standard hellenistic iconography illustration above right further support for this theory is the presence of a lion and a cup in some depictions of the tauroctony indeed leo a lion and aquarius the cup bearer were the constellations seen as the northernmost summer solstice and southernmost winter solstice positions in the sky during the age of taurus the precession of the equinoxes was discovered or at least publicized by the greek astronomer hipparchus in the two nd century bc whether the phenomenon was known by mithraists previously is unknown in any case mithras was presumed to be very powerful if he was able to rotate the heavens and thus kill the bull or displacing taurus as the reigning image in the heavens some commentators surmise that the mithraists worshipped mithras as the mediator between man and the supreme god of the upper and nether world other commentators inspired by james frazer s theories have additionally labeled mithras a mystery religion with a life death rebirth deity comparable to isis the resurrected jesus or the persephone demeter cult of the eleusinian mysteries history of mithraism mithraism in persia iran relief from taq i bostan iran showing ardashir ii of sassanid empire at the center receiving his crown from ahura mazda the two stand on a prostrate enemy at the left is mithra depicted as a priest wearing a crown of sun rays holding a priest s barsam and standing on a sacred lotus mithraism is generally considered to be of persian origins specifically an outgrowth of zoroastrian culture though not of zoroaster s teachings for zoroaster was a monotheist for whom ahuramazda was the one god darius the great was equally stringent in the official monotheism of his reign no god but ahuramazda is ever mentioned in any of the numerous inscriptions that survive of his reign five two one four eight five bc however the official cult is rarely the sole religion in an area the following inscription from susa of artaxerxes ii mnemon four zero four three five eight bc demonstrates that not all the achaemenid kings were as purely zoroastrian as darius the great artaxerxes the great king says by the favor of ahuramazda anahita and mithra this palace i built may ahuramazda anahita and mithra protect me from all evil and that which i have built may they not shatter nor harm it is tempting to identify the roman mithras with the persian mithra except that there is no known persian legend or text about mithra killing a bull or being associated with other animals on the other hand there is a story of ahriman the evil god in popular developments of zoroastrianism killing a bull it is easy to explain the sun god mithra being worshipped in the windowless cave like mithraeum each night the sun was thought to journey through the underworld after sunset from west to east until sunrise a possible link between persia and rome which could be the stage for these changes may be the kingdoms of parthia and pontus in asia minor several of their kings were called mithradates meaning given by mithra starting with mithradates i of parthia died one three eight bc it would seem that in those kingdoms mithra was a god whose power lent luster even to a king and it was at pergamum in the two nd century bc that greek sculptors started to produce bas relief imagery of mithra taurocthonos mithra the bull slayer although the cult of mithras never caught on in the greek homeland those sculptures may indicate the route between persian mithra and roman mithras around the first century ad the greek historian plutarch wrote about pirates of cilicia who practiced the mithraic secret rites around six seven bc since cilicia was the coastal province in the southeast of anatolia the mithras mentioned by plutarch may have been worship of the persian god mithra or may have been associated with ahriman the persian god who killed a bull mithraism in early rome double faced mithraic relief rome two nd three rd century ce louvre museum front mithra killing the bull being looked over by the sun god and the moon god back mithra banquetting with the sun god to celebrate his victory over the dark forces of the universe mithraism arrived fully mature at rome with the return of the legions from the east in the first century bc as an action god of armies and the champion of heroes he appealed to the professional roman soldiers who carried his cult to iberia britain the german frontiers and dacia the cult of mithras began to attract attention at rome about the end of the first century ad perhaps in connection with the conquest of then zoroastrian armenia the earliest material evidence for the roman worship of mithras dates from that period in a record of roman soldiers who came from the military garrison at carnuntum in the roman province of upper pannonia near the danube river in modern austria near the hungarian border these soldiers fought against the parthians and were involved in the suppression of the revolts in jerusalem from six zero a d to about seven zero a d when they returned home they made mithraic dedications probably in the year seven one or seven two statius mentions the typical mithraic relief in his thebaid book i seven one nine seven two zero around a d eight zero plutarch s life of pompey also makes it clear that the worship of mithras was well known at that time by a d two zero zero mithraism had spread widely through the army and also among traders and slaves the german frontiers have yielded most of the archaeological evidence of its prosperity small cult objects connected with mithra turn up in archaeological digs from romania to hadrian s wall mithraism in the roman empire sol invictus on the reverse of this coin by usurper victorinus at rome the third century emperors encouraged mithraism because of the support which it afforded to the divine nature of monarchs mithras thus became the giver of authority and victory to the imperial house from the time of commodus who participated in its mysteries its supporters were to be found in all classes concentrations of mithraic temples are found on the outskirts of the roman empire along hadrian s wall in northern england three mithraea have been identified at housesteads carrawburgh and rudchester the discoveries are in the university of newcastle s museum of antiquities where a mithraeum has been recreated recent excavations in london have uncovered the remains of a mithraic temple near to the center of the once walled roman settlement on the bank of the walbrook stream mithraea have also been found along the danube and rhine river frontier in the province of dacia where in two zero zero three a temple was found in alba iulia and as far afield as numidia in north africa as would be expected mithraic ruins are also found in the port city of ostia and in rome the capital where as many as seven hundred mithraea may have existed a dozen have been identified its importance at rome may be judged from the abundance of monumental remains more than seven five pieces of sculpture one zero zero mithraic inscriptions and ruins of temples and shrines in all parts of the city and its suburbs a well preserved late two nd century mithraeum with its altar and built in stone benches originally built beneath a roman house as was a common practice survives in the crypt over which has been built the basilica of san clemente rome the demise of mithraism worship of the sun sol did exist within the indigenous roman pantheon as a minor part and always as a pairing with the moon however in the east there were many solar deities including the greek helios who was largely displaced by apollo by the three rd century the popular cults of apollo and mithras had started to merge into the syncretic cult known as sol invictus and in two seven four ce the emperor aurelian whose mother had been a priestess of the sun made worship of sol invictus official subsequently aurelian built a splendid new temple in rome and created a new body of priests to support it pontifex solis invicti attributing his victories in the east to sol invictus but none of this affected the existing cult of mithras which remained a non official cult some senators held positions in both cults however this period was also the beginning of the decline of mithraism as dacia was lost to the empire and invasions of the northern peoples resulted in the destruction of temples along a great stretch of frontier the main stronghold of the cult the spread of christianity through the empire boosted by constantine s tolerance of it from around three one zero ce also took its toll particularly as christianity admitted women while mithraism did not which obviously limited its potential for rapid growth the reign of julian who attempted to restore the faith and suppress christianity and the usurpation of eugenius renewed the hopes of its devotees but the decree secured by theodosius in three nine four totally forbidding non christian worship may be considered the end of mithraism s formal public existence mithraism still survived in certain cantons of the alps into the five th century and clung to life with more tenacity in its eastern homelands its eventual successor as the carrier of persian religion to the west was manichaeism which competed strenuously with christianity for the status of world religion connections there is much speculation that christian beliefs were influenced by mithraic belief ernest renan in the origins of christianity promoted the idea that mithraism was the prime competitor to christianity in the second through the fourth century ad although some scholars feel the written claims that the emperors nero commodus septimius severus caracalla and the tetrarchs were initiates are dubious as there is little evidence that mithraic worship was accorded official status as a roman cult other than its official form as sol invictus the first universal religion of the greco roman world bull and cave themes are found in christian shrines dedicated to the archangel michael who after the legalization of christianity became the patron saint of soldiers many of those shrines were converted mithraea for instance the sacred cavern at monte gargano in apulia refounded in four nine three it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the mithras cult was transferred to the previously unvenerated archangel bull and crypt are linked in the catholic saint saturnin frequently sernin or saturninus of toulouse france the mithraeum is retained as a crypt under his earliest church evocatively named notre dame du taur it has also been speculated that the ancient orobouros of mithraism the encircling serpent about to bite its own tail was adapted for a christian symbol of the limited confines of time and space the snake around a rock also is reminscent of the midgard serpent j rmungandr who was said to surround midgard the earth according to norse traditions christians would argue that because the gospels are thought to have been mostly before one zero zero and that since very little is known of roman mithraism until after one zero zero that it is implausible to say that christianity borrowed its doctrines from mithraism some christians have suggested that mithraism may have in fact borrowed elements from christianity other non christian scholars disagree with the conclusions a better determinant of borrowing is to compare core doctrines between christianity and mithraism the adoption of imagery or icons or festivals is fairly peripheral such as the adoption by christendom of winter solstice or saturnalia festivals as christmas but seldom reflects basic religious tenets a further example of this is the various gnostic cults such as pelagianism which adopted the personage of jesus or the concept of a savior yet did not adopt the underlying doctrinal elements similarities to christianity according to martin a larson in the story of christian origins one nine seven seven mithraism and christianity derived from the same sources originally from the savior cult of osiris a rarely discussed view among mithraic and christian scholars but which accounts for the similarities without assuming a christian deriviation from mithraism he also believes that the essenes were jewish pythagoreans whose members not only gave birth to christianity as essenes but were directly influenced by zoroastrian doctrine as pythagoreans mithraism an established but exclusive sect devoted to social justice was assimilated by state sponsored christianity before being disposed of in name the resemblances between the two churches were so striking as to impress even the minds of antiquity cumont one nine three like origen an early christian apologist mithraism held that all souls pre existed in the ethereal regions with god and inhabited a body upon birth similar to pythagorean essene and pauline theology life then becomes the great struggle between good and evil spirit and body ending in judgment with the elect being saved they both admitted to the existence of a heaven inhabited by beautiful ones and a hell peopled by demons situate in the bowels of earth cumont one nine one both religions purified themselves through baptism and each participated in an outwardly similar type of sacrament bread and wine both the birth of mithra and the birth of christ have been celebrated on december two five th although nowhere does the bible claim that christ was born on this day both mithra and christ were supposedly visited by shepherds and magi both mithraism and christianity considered sunday their holy day many have noted that the title of pope father is found in mithraic doctrine and seemingly prohibited in christian doctrine the words peter rock and mass sacrament have original significance in mithraism mithraism and early christianity considered abstinence celibacy and self control to be among their highest virtues both had similar beliefs about the world destiny heaven and hell and the immortality of the soul their conceptions of the battles between good and evil were almost identical including a great and final battle at the end of times christianity adopted the millennial epochs that were integral to mithraism from zoroastrianism mithraism s flood at the beginning of history was deemed necessary because what began in water would end in fire according to mithraic eschatology both religions believed in revelation as key to their doctrine as do most religions both awaited the last judgment and resurrection of the dead christ and mithra were both referred to directly as the logos larson one eight four when inducted into the degree of leo he was purified with honey and baptised not with water but with fire as john the baptist declared that his successor would baptise after this second baptism initiates were considered participants and they received the sacrament of bread and wine commemorating mithra s banquet at the conclusion of his labors larson one nine zero although the cult of mithra rivaled christianity in rome they were among different social classes mithra was popular among soldiers and nobles after four centuries of growth mithraism had a disadvantage to christian populism by barring women and emphasizing the elitist nature of the belief under emperors like julian and commodus mithra became the patron of roman armies cumont eight seven christians referred to themselves as soldiers of christ they venerated jesus in mithraic sun god fashion calling him light of the world or son sun of righteousness christians also claimed their savior s death was marked by a solar eclipse sunday became the primary day of worship for christians despite observing the jewish sabbath for centuries mithra s birthday was adopted by christians in the four th century a d as the birth of christ j smith one four

easter when the sun rises toward its apogee mithra performed miracles of raising the dead healing the sick making the blind see the lame walk and casting out devils as a peter son of the petra rock he carried the keys to the kingdom of heaven as st peter is said to have the keys to the gates of heaven h smith one two nine before returning to heaven mithra had his last supper with his twelve

depiction of mithra a true sun god but which also depicts christ in a similar way however differences such as star gazing were persecuted as heresy although zodiac beliefs were too common by then to be removed trypho wrote that justin martyr declared that in a certain cave near bethlehem mary brought forth the christ those who presided over the mysteries of mithras were stirred up by the devil to

zero s by chrysler uk in partnership with the french manufacturer matra who were also affiliated with simca the former french subsidiary of the chrysler corporation who were sold in one nine seven seven to the psa group peugeot citro n the chrysler uk matra design was originally intended to be sold as a talbot and to be a replacement for the talbot matra simca rancho station wagon early prototypes were designed to use simca parts and hence featured a grille reminiscent of the simca one three zero seven however after acquiring all of chrysler s european assets psa decided the design was too expensive and risky to put into production and matra took their idea to renault who agreed psa finally ventured into the minivan sector one one years later with the citro n evasion peugeot eight zero six the matra concept became the renault espace however chrysler under whom matra had originally conceived the espace had also been developing the minivan concept themselves and managed to release their own dodge caravan a year earlier than the espace in one nine eight three the term minivan derived from the fact that cars such as the dodge caravan were considerably smaller than traditional north american passenger vans such as the ford e series the target market for the minivan was families living in suburban areas this vehicle was a cross between the station wagon and the large work vans that people would customize for passenger travel in north america it came at a time when families wanted a different vehicle that didn t have the stigma of the station wagon era of their parents and also wanted better fuel economy than that of the previously popular v eight powered station wagons vans the minivan also offered another change from the large van or the station wagon front wheel drive usually found only on smaller automobiles this made for easier assembly of the vehicle and allowed for more cargo passenger area along the floor with the absence of the drive shaft hump minivans typically have removable seats and with the seats removed the cargo area in the larger minivans can hold a four x eight sheet of drywall or plywood flat in the usa in order for the style of minivan to circumvent the one nine eight zero s emission standards the minivan had to be classified as a truck and could not have four doors like a car early us minivans such as the dodge caravan were three door configurations with a sliding curbside door early minivans came with four cylinder motors which although they were more efficient were not able to meet the life span of bigger engines it was common to require major engine repairs on the four cylinder motors the vehicles were also extremely sluggish when these small engines were paired with hydraulic automatic transmissions later six cylinder motors were offered and have become a standard choice by purchasers who plan to operate the vehicle for many years minivans are also notorious for having problems with their transaxles current models two zero zero six full size mazda mpv left and compact mazda five right minivans modern minivans are now very similar to station wagons except they have a higher profile also their hood is shorter as they have more vertical room current models have two sliding doors or normal doors if they are compact minivans all minivans sold in north america have sliding doors with the exception of the first generation mazda mpv honda odyssey and isuzu oasis today many minivan manufacturers including ford gm and daimlerchrysler also offer their minivans as cargo vans rather than passenger vans these cargo vans are usually available only through fleet sales buick gl eight sold in china the trend for compact minivans or mini mpvs began in europe in the late one nine nine zero s with the launch of the renault sc nic compact minivans were usually cars with minivan bodies but based on the chassis and engines of a compact car in the case of the sc nic the renault m gane the runaway success of the sc nic saw the car spawn a multitude of imitators including the general motors zafira the citro n xsara picasso the volkswagen touran and the nissan almera tino by the mid two zero zero zero s virtually all mainstream automakers in europe had a mini mpv in their range also in the mid two zero zero zero s manufacturers began to use minivan style designs on even smaller chassis in cars such as the opel meriva based on the corsa supermini such models enjoyed some popularity in the united states in the late one nine eight zero s and early one nine nine zero s for example the mitsubishi expo mitsubishi chariot in other markets and nissan access for two zero zero six the lone compact minivan available in the united states is the mazda five in the asean nations and india because of the wide geography of the region muvs tend to be smaller cars that can cope with the terrain among these muvs are the chevrolet tavera isuzu panther ford fusion hindustan pushpak toyota qualis replaced by the toyota innova etc public image in the usa a stack of hot wheels toy dodge caravans minivans have a mixed image they have a reputation for poor maneuverability and performance in comparison with other types of vehicles however they are also the vehicle of choice for large suburban families and are frequently associated with soccer moms perhaps because of these associations minivan are often seen as dowdy or boring many buyers who need a car with a large amount of luggage and passenger space prefer the rugged go anywhere image of suvs or the sporty upscale image of european station wagons like the bmw three series or the volvo v seven zero provide whether large suvs such as the chevrolet suburban and ford expedition are affected by similar stigmas as their designers attempt to compete with minivan comfort and convenience remains to be seen minivan model prototype oddities the concept version of the pontiac trans sport was small and had a wingflap

throws her tam o shanter cap up in the air in a freeze frame at the end of the montage fans have noted that the statue takes a couple of liberties with that opening scene for both practical and artistic reasons one is that where mary actually tossed the cap was in the crosswalk in the middle of the street clearly not the best location for a statue the other is that the actual release point of the cap was around her waist whereas the statue has her hand high overhead barely touching the cap as if she were catching it instead of tossing it mary tyler moore is referenced in the hit song

the cause of god aftermath of shoghi effendi s passing when shoghi effendi passed away in one nine five seven the hands of the cause met in a private conclave at bahj in haifa and determined that he hadn t appointed a successor they decided that since such a situation wasn t provided for in any explicit text where a guardian doesn t appoint a succesor that it would need to be reviewed and ejudicated upon by the universal house of justice which hadn t been elected yet remey signed a unnanimous declaration of the hands that shoghi effendi had died without having appointed his successor remey had always insisted on the importance of finding a guardian and held the fundamental belief that there must and will always be a guardian common belief amongst the other hands of the cause was that this could not happen as the guardian must be aghsan a term used to describe male descendants of bah u ll h of which there were none remaining in one nine six zero remey himself proclaimed to be the guardians on the grounds that he was appointed by virtue of being the president of the first international bah council the embyronic universal house of justice and only a guardian can lead the house the original persian cablegram notifiying that he would be president used the term ra is meaning in both arabic and farsi president or head of the ibc ra is is the same term used by abdu l bah in his will and testament in the passage referring to the guardian as the sacred head and distinguished member of the universal house of justice he claimed to have been adopted by abdu l bah in a private meeting and being called my son was a public recognition thereby making him an adopted descendant of bah u ll h or aghsan given that he did not renounce his attempt the hands of the cause and remey formed a schism in the religion each excommunicating the other as covenant breakers remey continued the teachings of bah u ll h under the title orthodox bah s under the hereditary guardian although remey was initially unsuccessful to garner more than a hundred supporters the french national spiritual assembly led by joel bray marangella formed a narrow majority to support remey and was dispanded marangella was one of remey s staunchest supporters for a few years before claiming to be the third guardian after remey had appointed him second guardian successorship from before one nine six nine through remey s death in one nine seven four and beyond there was a dispute over successsion that divided remey s followers into several divisions only three remain as the others appear to be defunct joel bray marangella after his proclamation in one nine six zero remey went on to form the second international bah council and appointed joel bray marangella to be its president in one nine six two remey gave marangella a sealed envelope with instructions to open it when the time was right in one nine six five mason remey called for the council to become active and marangella opened the sealed letter which was a hand written note by mason appointing marangella as his successor shortly afterward remey deactivated the council once marangella shared this appointment in one nine six nine he attracted his own following around himself while remey was still alive called the orthodox bah faith donald harvey in one nine six seven remey publically declared that he was choosing donald harvey to be his successor whilst just two years later marangella made his proclamation to being the third guardian asserting that when remey activated the second international bah council he ceased being the guardian at that moment since he claimed there could only be one guardian alive at a time remey never commented on the matter further than stating that according to the will and testament of abdu l bah the guardian is the guardian for life he never denounced maragella for his actions despite being openly attacked by him and publicly ridiculed those who followed donald harvey accepted his appointed successor jacques shogomonian who now claims to be the fourth guardian of the bah faith under the group called bah s loyal to the fourth guardian pepe remey in florence italy one nine six four remey adopted as his son an italian bah named joseph pepe who he had known since the one nine five zero s pepe served as remey s personal secretary until remey s death in one nine seven four in his will remey left pepe all things tangible and intangible which some believe included the guardianship although pepe never went about collecting believers around himself he was proactive in publicising details about his adopted father s life dr leland jensen a supporter of remey put forward pepe as the third guardian since neither of mason s other two appointees were sons or aghsan he pointed to the provision in the will and testament of abdu l bah that states the successor must be a first born son or an aghsan page one four being remey s son and being appointed jensen claimed made the other non hereditary appointments irrelevent especially due to the fact that mason referred to his own guardianship as the hereditary guardianship pepe never accepted being the leader of jensen s bah s under the provisions of the covenant bupc letters written by pepe remey to individual believers contradict each other stating in some that he was never a bah nor the guardian and in others that he had been a bah since the early five zero s when he met mason and that he was of course mason s successor one of jensen s followers neal chase claims to have been adopted and appointed privately by

and music where the work is stripped down to its most fundamental features in other fields of art it has been used to describe the novels of ernest hemingway the plays of samuel beckett the films of robert bresson the stories of raymond carver called the king of minimalism and even the automobile designs of colin chapman as a specific movement in the arts it is identified with developments in post world war ii western art most strongly with the visual arts for example the paintings of mark rothko the term has expanded to encompass a movement in music which features repetition and iteration for example the music of steve reich philip glass and terry riley see also post minimalism it is rooted in the spare aspects of modernism and is often associated with postmodernism and reaction against expressionism in both painting and composition the term minimalist can also refer to anything which is spare stripped to its essentials or providing only the outline of structure independent of the particular art movement and minimalism the tendency to reduce to fundamentals it is sometimes applied to groups or individuals practicing asceticism and the reduction of physical possessions and needs to a minimum minimalism in visual art one of dan flavin s lighting tube installations stack by donald judd a minimalist painting for example will typically use a limited number of colors and have a simple geometric design minimalist sculpture on the other hand is greatly focused on the materials see david smith and donald judd while many believe minimalism to be a movement specific to geometric representations it extends far outside this constraint there were three notable phases of the minimalist movement first the distillation of the forms wherein the greatest contributors were probably the russian constructivists and the romanian sculptor constantin br ncu i the russian constructivists proclaiming the distillation was in order to create a universal language of art which the masses were meant to understand it may have also supported the rapid industrialization planned for the massive country br ncu i s work was much more of a search for the purity of the form and thus paved the way for the abstractions that were to come such as minimalism the second and most notable phase in the movement came with artists including carl andre anne truitt dan flavin sol lewitt frank stella donald judd ad reinhardt and robert smithson it commenced in one nine six four with the exhibition of dan flavin s monument for v tatlin which was an assembly of neon lighting tubes the tubes

explicitly stated that their art was not self expression in complete opposition to the previous decade s abstract expressionists very soon they created a minimal style whose features included rectangular and cubic forms purged of all metaphor equality of parts repetition neutral surfaces industrial materials all of which leads to immediate visual impact later minimal sculptors included tony smith larry bell and john mccracken ad reinhardt summed up the style in these terms the more stuff in it the busier the work of art the worse it is more is less less is more the eye is a menace to clear sight the laying bare of oneself is obscene art begins with the getting rid of nature this style was heavily criticised it was called futile mechanistic mandarin elitist circular pedantic and authoritarian some critics thought they were dealing with outright fraud also notable are the post minimalists including martin puryear tyrone mirchell melvin edwards and joel shapiro the keystone of post minimalism is the often distinct references to objects without direct representation this has become a predominant trend in modern sculpture musical minimalism main article minimalist music the cover of the beatles so called white album in classical music of the last three five years the term minimalism is sometimes applied to music which displays some or all of the following features repetition often of short musical phrases with minimal variations over long periods of time or stasis often in the form of drones and long tones emphasis on consonant harmony a steady pulse minimalist music is sometimes very similar currently to electronic music and composition it should be noted that the minimalist movement in music bears only an occasional relationship to the movement of the same name in visual art this connection is probably one reason why many minimalist composers dislike the term philip glass whose group initially performed at art galleries where his minimalist visual artist friends were showing reportedly said of minimalism that word should be stamped out also the so called white album from the beatles released in one nine six eight can be seen as an part of minimalism in music the songs were very simple just guitar bass and drums but also the cover of the album plain white and in the beginning even without words can be seen as an piece of minimalism many people think this was a reaction to the vibe of the year one nine six seven the album came after the very colorful sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band with all it s little sounds and tricks minimalist design the term minimalism is also used to describe a trend in design and architecture wherein the subject is reduced to its necessary elements architect ludwig mies van der rohe adopted the motto to describe his aesthetic tactics of flattening and emphasizing the building s frame eliminating interior walls and adopting an open plan and reducing the structure to a strong transparent elegant skin designer buckminster fuller adopted a similar saying doing more with less but his concerns were more oriented towards technology and engineering than aesthetics contemporary architects working in this tradition include john pawson eduardo souto de moura tadao ando and peter zumthor literary minimalism literary minimalism is characterized by an economy with words minimalist authors eschew adverbs and prefer allowing context to dictate meaning readers are expected to take an active role in the creation of a story to choose sides based on oblique hints and innuendo rather than reacting to directions from the author the characters in minimalist stories and novels tend to be unexceptional they re average people who sell pool supplies or coach second tier athletic teams not famous detectives or the fabulously wealthy generally the short stories are slice of life stories some one nine four zero s era crime fiction of writers such as james m cain and jim thompson adopted a stripped down matter of fact prose style to considerable effect this prose style may be classified as minimalism another strand of literary minimalism arose in response to the meta fiction trend of the one nine six zero s and early one nine seven zero s john barth coover and william h gass these writers were also spare with prose and kept a psychological distance from their subject matter minimalist authors include the following raymond carver chuck palahniuk bret easton ellis amy hempel bobbie ann mason tobias wolff grace paley sandra cisneros mary robison and frederick barthelme the irish author samuel beckett is also known for writing minimalistic plays and short stories minimalism in philosophy minimalism in philosophy or minimalistic philosophies indicates a philosophy formed around only a few elements of life as opposed to the full spectrum people practicing minimalistic philosophies often resort to living life with the bare minimum of what is required to survive cults often claim to practice minimalistic philosophies where the leaders exhort their followers to abandon things of value in their lives including things as basic as clothes and the right to maintain personal hygiene most modern philosophies could also be considered minimalistic in that they resort to providing only a limited set of valued elements as opposed to everything a person needs to live their life for example a philosophy centered around only money minimalism postmodern art a magneto provides pulses of electrical power to the spark plugs in some petrol powered internal combustion engines where batteries are not available most commonly those in two stroke and four stroke engines used in small motorcycles lawnmowers and chainsaws as well as in most small aircraft and some racing automobiles serving a similar function to the coil type ignition system found in automobiles in aircraft typically each cylinder has two spark plugs each driven from a separate magneto this arrangement provides redundancy in the event of a failure of one of the magnetos and two sparks burn more efficiently than one magnetos combine the functions of a dynamo contact breaker points and coil into one unit the engine turns a permanent magnet inside a coil of wire to provide a basic source of electrical energy on each revolution a cam opens the contact breaker one or more times interrupting the current causing the voltage in the secondary winding of the coil to reach a very high value enough to arc across the electrodes of the spark plug because no battery or other source of energy is required the magneto is a rugged reliable and self contained solution to providing ignition of the fuel in some modern magneto designs an electronic switch replaces the contact breaker see

was a roman emperor two three five two three eight he was conspicuous as the first barbarian who wore the imperial purple and the first never to set foot in rome he was the first of the so called soldier emperors of the three rd century but certainly not the last his rule is often considered to mark the beginning of the crisis of the third century maximinus was born in thrace or moesia to a gothic father and an alanic mother he was reportedly eight feet six inches two five nine m tall and of tremendous strength he joined the army during the reign of septimius severus but did not rise to a powerful position until promoted by alexander severus maximinus was in command of the recruits from pannonia who were angered by alexander s payments to the alemanni and his avoidance of war the troops among which legio xxii primigenia elected the stern maximinus killing young alexander and his mother at moguntiacum mainz in two three five the praetorian guard acclaimed him emperor and their choice was grudgingly confirmed by the senate who were displeased to have a peasant as emperor maximinus hated the nobility and was ruthless towards those he suspected of plotting against him he began by eliminating the close advisors of alexander his suspicions may have been justified two plots against maximinus were foiled the first was during a campaign across the rhine during which a group of officers supported by influential senators plotted the destruction of a bridge across the river to leave maximinus stranded on the other side afterwards they planned to elect senator magnus emperor however the plot was discovered and the conspirators executed the second plot involved mesopotamian archers who were loyal to alexander they planned to elevate quartinus but their leader macedo changed sides and murdered quartinus instead although this was not enough to save his own life maximinus also reversed alexander s policy of clemency towards the christians who were viewed as unsupportive enemies of the state he persecuted christians ruthlessly and the bishop of rome pontian as well as his successor anterus are said to have been martyred his first campaign was against the alemanni who maximinus defeated despite heavy roman casualties in a swamp near what is today baden w rttemberg after the victory maximinus took the title germanicus maximus raised his son maximus to the rank of caesar and prince of youths and deified his late wife securing the german frontier at least for a while maximinus then set up a winter encampment at sirmium in pannonia now in northwest serbia near the bosnian and croatian borders and from that supply base fought the dacians and the sarmatians during the winter of two three five two three six maximinus coin maximinus doubled the pay of soldiers this act along with virtually continuous warfare required higher taxes tax collectors began to resort to violent methods and illegal confiscations further alienating the governing class early in two three eight in the province of africa tunisia a treasury official s extortions through false judgments in corrupt courts against some local landowners ignited a full scale revolt in the province the landowners armed their clients and their agricultural workers and entered thysdrus modern el djem where they murdered the offending official and his bodyguards and proclaimed the aged governor of the province gordian i and his son gordian ii as co emperors the senate in rome switched allegiance but when the african revolt collapsed the senators elected two of their number pupienus and balbinus as co emperors a faction in rome preferred gordian s grandson gordian iii and there was severe street fighting maximinus marched on rome but at aquileia maximinus s troops suffering from famine and disease bogged down in an unexpected siege of the city which had closed its gates when they approached became disaffected praetorian guards in his camp assassinated him his son and his

series creator hodgson originally played the stranded man joel robinson when he left in one nine nine three series head writer michael j nelson replaced him as new b movie victim mike nelson and continued in the role for the rest of the show s run the format proved to be influential during its eleven years and one nine eight episodes including one feature film mst three k attained a fiercely loyal fan base and much critical acclaim the series also garnered a peabody award in one nine nine three premise two mad scientists dr clayton forrester played by trace beaulieu and his sidekick dr laurence erhardt played by josh weinstein launch joel robinson hodgson a janitor working for the gizmonics institute into space and force him to watch truly horrible b movies they do this in order to measure how much bad movie making it takes to drive a person crazy and to pinpoint the perfect b movie to use as a weapon in dr forrester s scheme of world domination the tv s frank played by frank conniff replaced dr erhardt in the second season premiere following weinstein s departure from the series gypsy trapped on board the satellite of love s o l a reference to a lou reed song joel builds the robots that populate the ship ostensibly because he is lonely and as an homage to the one nine seven zero s film silent running the robots are tom servo voiced first by weinstein then by kevin

patrick brantseg both using a falsetto voice who does not appear in every episode but handles the higher functions of the s o l such as steering the ship and cambot the recorder of the experiments who is never visible but occasionally interacts with the others also making intermittent appearances in the show s early years is magic voice a disembodied female voice whose primary role is to announce the start of the first commercial break in each episode joel has no control over when the movies start for as the theme song states he used those special parts to make his robot friends as the movies play the silhouettes of joel tom and crow are visible at the bottom of the screen wisecracking and mocking the movie a practice they often referred to as riffing to prevent being driven mad just before or after commercial breaks joel and later mike and the bots sometimes perform skits songs or other short sketch pieces called host segments that are often related to the movie they are watching these segments sometimes even feature visits by prominent characters from the movie such as torgo from manos the hands of fate but before too much frivolity can transpire the movie sign lights flash signaling the resumption of the movie many episodes also include screenings of unintentionally hilarious short films or shorts including propaganda style films from the one nine five zero s such as a training film for chevrolet sales managers and films intended to teach children about posture or personal hygiene these are less frequent in later episodes history the satellite of love mystery science theater three zero zero zero first aired on local tv in the twin cities on ktma tv a uhf station not a cable access channel as is sometimes reported from november two four one nine eight eight to may one nine eight nine the station s declining fortunes forced it to cancel mst three k but just as its run was ending the creators used a short best of reel to pitch the concept to executives at the comedy channel a national cable channel that was then being created it became one of the first two shows picked up by it after one season there comedy channel and rival comedy cable network ha merged to become comedy central it would run there for six more seasons reigning as its signature series for several years before falling out of favor with the network s management when comedy central dropped the show after a shorter than normal seventh season mst three k s internet fan base staged a precedent setting write in campaign to keep the show alive this included taking contributions from mst three k fans worldwide for a full page ad in the television trade publication daily variety magazine one notable contributor to the campaign was tv personality and biography host jack perkins who had been parodied on the series several times this effort led the sci fi channel to pick up the series where it resumed with some cast changes and ran for three more seasons the series finale premiered on august eight one nine nine nine although an episode produced earlier in the season was the last new episode of mst three k broadcast on september one two one nine nine nine reruns continued on the sci fi channel until january three one two zero zero four in total there were one nine eight full episodes of mst three k the show s run coincided with the growth of the internet and numerous fans msties devoted websites to the series the internet also facilitated tape trading of previous episodes among fans a practice the show s creators encouraged by flashing the phrase keep circulating the tapes during the closing credits of episodes every episode during seasons two three and four before season five started lawyers alerted them that the phrase may constitute a support of piracy there were two official fan conventions in minneapolis run by the series production company itself zanily called conventiocon expofest a rama one nine nine four and conventiocon expofest a rama

producer steven spielberg writer director paul schrader former vice president al gore time film critic richard corliss singer songwriter weird al yankovic and msnbc anchor keith olbermann cambot as he appeared in the early years of the series when joel hodgson decided to leave the series halfway through season five an episode was written in which his character escaped from the s o l after being forced to sit through the joe don baker movie mitchell joel escaped with the help of gypsy and mike nelson a hired by doctor forrester to help to prepare for an audit from the fraternal order of mad science after they discovered an escape pod named the deus ex machina in a box marked hamdingers to replace joel dr forrester sent mike up in his place the series head writer michael j nelson played mike from one nine nine three until the end of the series debates sometimes heated raged in fan forums about who was the better host for quite some time but in more recent years a consensus has developed among the fanbase that acknowledges that each performer had his merits a feature film in which mike and the bots worked over this island earth was released in one nine nine six during the gap in the show s run between seasons six and seven which explains the absence of both tv s frank and pearl forrester unfortunately universal studios invested few resources into the resultant mystery science theater three zero zero zero the movie the film was never given wide release instead playing for a limited time in different cities and then moving to another city the result was that many fans did not even know it had been released the widowmaker pearl forrester used during the eight th season before the series moved to the sci fi channel trace beaulieu who played dr forrester and crow departed the series in his place was mary jo pehl as dr forrester s mother pearl her sidekicks were the idiotic planet of the apes inspired professor bobo played by murphy and the highly evolved omniscient yet equally idiotic observer aka brain guy played by writer bill corbett corbett also competently took over crow s voice and puppetry in the middle of the first season on the sci fi channel the eighth national season overall mallon handed over the voice and puppetry work for gypsy to bbi staffer patrick brantseg at first sci fi channel officials mandated that every movie featured on the revived series had to fit within the channel s broad definition of science fiction which included horror and fantasy instead of the varied genres present in past shows but by the final season this restriction seemed to be loosened allowing movies such as girl in gold boots and the joe don baker film final justice in any event the network s vast library of science fiction films provided an

states music radio is a radio format where music is the primary source of broadcast content on both commercial and non commercial stations after the rise of television brought about the decline of old time radio and its dramatic content music formats became one of the dominant forms of radio in many countries though radio drama and comedy continues often on public radio music has been one of the driving factors in the advancement of radio technology from the adoption of wide band fm to the current upswing in digital media music radio and culture music radio particularly top four zero has often acted as both a barometer and an arbiter of musical taste and radio airplay is one of the defining measures of success in the mainstream musical world in fact the rise of rock music to popularity is intimately tied to the history of music radio early forms of rock had languished in poor areas of the south it was enjoyed mostly by rural blacks rock music entered the mainstream during the one nine five zero s because of controversial white djs such as wolfman jack and alan freed with an appreciation for black music for many years many listeners have been dissatisfied with the content of radio programming since the decline of early free form rock radio the popularity of offshore pirate radio stations in the united kingdom was an early symptom of frustration with the often overly safe and occasionally politicized playlists of commercial radio the growth of internet radio from a small experimenter s toy in the mid nine zero s to a huge phenomenon allowing both small do it yourselfers and large commercial stations to make their offerings available worldwide was seen as a threat to over the air music broadcasting and was nearly shut down by onerous licensing demands made by the recording industry meanwhile the rise of satellite radio services as a major competitor have brought many of the advantages of internet radio to an increasingly mobile listening public including lack of censorship greater choice a more eclectic approach to format programming and static free digital sound quality indeed one size fits all programming is no longer seen as tenable by some as the diversity of musical tastes among the listening public have created a proliferation of radio formats in what some might call a form of narrowcasting how it works cost of programming stations usually adopt a music format to gain the greatest number of listeners for the least expense this reasoning is common in both commercial and non commercial stations since the programming content has already been produced all that a station has to provide is the low cost on air programming between records most music radio stations pay licensing fees to licensing agencies such as ascap or bmi as do most commercial businesses that wish to use music as part of their business as a result while most commercial stations might get their music for free they still have to pay royalties to actually play it some small neighborhood sized stations can play unlisted locally produced music and avoid these fees licensing issues nearly destroyed internet radio during the first years of the two one st century in the united states congress intervened to create a royalty structure that while expensive to independent operators running on a shoestring was far less onerous than the scale demanded by the riaa currently one service provider live three six five provides programs that handle licensing issues in addition both xm and sirius provide commercial packages that allow the exclusive use though not rebroadcast of their music programming by businesses license free commercial radio commercial stations charge advertisers for the estimated number of listeners the larger the audience the higher the stations rate card can be for commercial advertising commercial stations program the format of the station to gain as large a slice of the demographic audience as possible a station s value is usually measured as a percentage of market share in a market of a certain size the measurement in u s markets has historically been by arbitron a commercial statistical service that uses listener diaries arbitron diaries were historically collected on thursdays and for this reason most radio stations have run special promotions on thursdays hoping to persuade last minute arbitron diarists to give them a larger market share stations are contractually prohibited from mentioning arbitron on the air market share is not always a consideration because not all radio stations are commercial public radio is funded by government and private donors since most public broadcasting operations don t have to make a profit no commercials are necessary also satellite radio either charges subscribers or is operated by a public broadcasting service therefore satellite radio rarely carries commercials or tries to raise money from donors the lack of commercial interruptions in satellite radio is an important advantage often the only breaks in a satellite music station s programming are for station identification and dj introductions internet radio stations exist that follow all of these plans much early commercial radio was completely freeform this changed drastically with the payola scandals of the one nine five zero s as a result djs seldom have complete programming freedom occasionally a special situation or highly respected long established personality is given such freedom most programming is done by the program director program directors may work for the station or at a central location run by a corporate network the dj s function is generally reduced to introducing and playing songs many stations target younger listeners because advertisers believe that advertising can change a younger person s product choice older people are thought to be less easy to change programming music radio has several possible arrangements originally it had blocks of sponsored airtime that played music from a live orchestra in the one nine three zero s phonograph records especially the single let a disc jockey introduce individual songs or introduce blocks of songs since then the program has been arranged so that commercials are followed by the content that is most valuable to the audience because dead air does not attract listeners the station tries to fill its broadcast day with sound audiences will only tolerate a certain number of commercials before tuning away in some regions government regulators specify how many commercials can be played in a given hour programming is different for non traditional broadcasting the jack fm format eliminates djs entirely as do many internet radio stations the music is simply played if it is announced it is by rds for fm broadcast or id three tags for internet broadcast satellite radio usually uses djs but their programming blocks are longer and not distinguished much by the time of day in addition receivers usually display song titles so announcing them is not needed internet and satellite broadcasting are not considered public media so treaties and statutes concerning obscenity transmission of ciphers and public order do not apply to those formats so satellite and internet radio are free to provide sexually explicit coarse and political material typical providers include playboy radio uncensored rap and hard rock stations and outlaw country music stations the wide reach and selective non broadcast usage of the internet allows programmers access to special interest audiences as a result both mainstream and narrow interest webcasts flourish in particular electronic music stations are much more common on the internet than they are in satellite or broadcast media jingles are the musical equivalent of neon signs and they can be remarkably beautiful jingles are brief bright pieces of choral music that promote the station s call letters frequency and sometimes disc jockey or program segment jingles were produced for radio stations by commercial speciality services the most famous jingle service was called pams external link based in texas jingles are not as common as they used to be often being replaced by recorded voiceovers sometimes called stingers the station will usually have a policy of announcing time station call letters and frequency as often as six times per hour in order to build station loyalty jingles can very useful for giving the station a branded sound in a pleasant minimal amount of air time the legal requirement for station identification in the u s is once per hour approximately at the top of the hour or at the conclusion of a transmission news time checks real time travel advice and weather reports are often quite valuable to listeners the news headlines and station identification are often given just before a commercial time traffic and weather are given just after the engineer typically sets the station clocks to standard local time each day by listening to wwv or wwvh see atomic clock although valued by commuters and older people these segments are less valued by young people so many stations that prefer to attract young listeners prefer to play music and shorten or omit these segments while most music stations that do offer news reports may simply tear and read news items from the newswires or the internet larger stations generally those affiliated with news talk stations may employ an editor to rewrite headlines and provide summaries of local news the summaries allow more news to fit in less air time some stations can share news collection with tv or newspapers in the same media conglomerate an emerging trend is to use the radio station s web site to provide in depth coverage of news and advertisers head lined on the air similarly many stations contract with agencies such as smartraveler and accuweather for their weather and traffic reports instead of having in house staff to do the job most radio stations maintain a call in telephone line for use during promotions and gags or to take record requests djs generally answer the phone and edit the call during music plays some stations take requests by e mail or even online chat promotions are usually the on air equivalent of lotteries for listeners promotional budgets usually run about one per listener per year in a large market a successful radio station can pay a full time director of promotions and several lotteries per month of vacations automobiles and other prizes lottery items are often bartered from advertisers allowing both companies to charge full prices while incurring wholesale costs for example consider a cruise vacation cruising companies often have unused capacity and when given the choice prefer to pay their bills by bartering vacations since the ship will sail in any case bartered vacations cost the cruise company little or nothing the promotion is itself advertising for the company providing the prize programming by time most music stations have djs that play music from a playlist determined by the program director arranged by blocks of time though practices differ by region and format what follows is a typical arrangement in a north american urban commercial radio station the first block of the day is the drive time block in the early morning typically five or six am to midmorning nine to one one am this block usually includes news bulletins and traffic and weather advisories for commuters as well as light comedy from the morning dj team many shock jocks started as or still work on drive time radio some stations emphasize music and reduce gags and call ins in this period the midday block is mostly music for a period around noon a station may play nonstop music or go to an all request format for people eating lunch in the early evening the evening rush hour programming resembles the midday programming but adds traffic and weather advisories for commuters some stations insert a short snippet of standup comedy around five o clock when commuters leave work the evening block if present returns to music the overnight programming is generally low key music with quiet announcing some stations play documentaries or even infomercials while some others play syndicated djs like delilah it is not uncommon to play more adventurous selections during late night programming blocks since late night is generally not considered significant for ratings weekends especially sundays often carry different programming common syndicated programming includes music countdown shows from djs such as rick dees and casey kasem retrospective shows and world music such as the putumayo world music hour stations may carry shows with different genres of music such as blues or jazz community affairs and religious programming is often on sunday mornings in addition weekend evenings are particularly specialized a dance station might have a sponsored dance party at a local club or a classical station may play an opera many music stations in the united states perform news and timechecks only sparingly preferring to put more music on the air news is often restricted to the talk heavy commuting hours the bbc takes a different approach with all of its stations giving news updates bbc one xtra produces its own news segments under the name tx music formats some well known music radio formats are top four zero freeform rock and aor album oriented rock it turns out that most other stations such as rhythm top four zero stations could sometimes be better described as top two zero stations they would aggressively skirt listener boredom to play only the most popular singles top four zero radio would punctuate the music with jingles promotions gags call ins and requests brief news time and weather announcements and most importantly advertising the distinguishing mark of a traditional top four zero station was the use of a hyperexcited disc jockey and high tempo jingles the format was invented in the us and today can be heard world wide todd storz and gordon mclendon invented top four zero radio bill drake and rick sklar have had a lasting modern influence this is an excellent brief history of the format variants and hybrids include the freeform like jack fm mentioned below under freeform rock and the mix formats mentioned below under oldies top four zero music is heavily criticized by some music fans as being repetitive and of low quality and is almost exclusively dominated by large media conglomerates such as clear channel communications and cbs corporation top four zero tends to be underrepresented on the internet being mostly the domain of commercial broadcasters such as virgin radio uk some of the most famous top four zero stations of have been musicradio seven seven wabc new york boss radio nine three khj am los angeles musicradio eight nine wls chicago and the big six eight wrko boston freeform and progressive rock a later development was freeform radio later commercially developed as progressive rock radio and still later even more commercially developed as aor album oriented rock in which selections from an album would be played together with an appropriate introduction traditional freeform stations prided themselves on offering their disc jockeys freedom to play significant music and make significant social commentary and humor this approach developed commercial problems because disc jockeys attracted to this freedom often had tastes substantially different from the audience and lost audience share also freeform stations could lack predictability and listeners loyalty could then be put at risk progressive rock radio not to be confused with the progressive rock music genre was freeform in style but constrained so that some kind of rock music was what was always or almost always played responsible jocks would realize their responsibility to the audience to produce a pleasant show and try to keep the station sound predictable by listening to other jocks and repeating some of their music selections wnew fm in new york during the one nine seven zero s exemplified this approach to progressive rock radio at their best freeform stations have never been equalled for their degree of social activism programmatic freedom and listener involvement however to succeed the approach requires genius jocks totally in tune with their audience who are also committed to the commercial success of the radio station this is a rare combination of traits even if such people are available they often command extremely high salaries however this may be an effective approach for a new station if talented jocks can be recruited and motivated at low salaries freeform radio is particularly popular as a college radio format offshoots include the recent and somewhat controversial due to its lack of on air personalities eclectic pop format known as jack fm from its first practitioner which plays a wide assortment of mostly top four zero music from a span of several decades and podcast radio a mostly talk format pioneered by infinity broadcasting s kyou station in california and adam curry s podcast show on sirius satellite radio aor album oriented rock aor album oriented rock developed as a commercial compromise between top forties style formulas and progressive rock radio freeform a program director or music consultant would select some set of music standards and require the playlist to be followed perhaps in an order selected by the jock the jock would still introduce each selection but the jock would have available a scripted introduction to use if he was not personally familiar with a particular piece of music and its artist obviously a computer helps a lot in this process a wonderful relatively safe compromise with the artistic freedom of the jocks is that a few times each hour usually in the least commecially valuable slots of the hour the disc jockey can highlight new tracks that he or she thinks might interest the audience the audience is encouraged to comment on the new tracks allowing the station to track audience tastes the freedom to introduce new artists can help a station develop its library significant aor offshoots include classic rock and adult album alternative oldies standards and classic rock not playing new artists has been described as a weakness of classic rock or oldies formats this is true in a creative but not a commercial sense stations will not get good ratings if they frequently play songs unfamiliar to their audience this is why top four zero stations played only the biggest hits and why oldies and classic rock formats do the same for the eras they cover nevertheless there seems to be a cottage industry of internet stations specializing in specific forms of classic rock and oldies particularly psychedelic rock and progressive rock the oldies and classic rock formats have a strong niche market but as the audience becomes older the station becomes less attractive to advertisers advertisers perceive older listeners as set in their brand choices and not as responsive to advertising as younger more impulsive listeners oldies stations must occasionally change to more youthful music formats as a result the definition of what constitutes an oldies station has gradually changed over the years this preference for younger listeners caused the decline of the big band or standards music formats that covered music from the one nine three zero s to the one nine five zero s as the audience grew too old for advertisers the radio stations that carried these formats saw a sharp loss of ratings and revenue this left them with no choice but to adopt more youthful formats though the standards format also known as the great american songbook from the series of albums produced by rocker rod stewart has undergone something of an off air revival with artists such as stewart tony bennett and queen latifah putting their own interpretation on the music during the mid to late nine zero s the mix format a loosely defined mixture of top four zero and classic rock with something of an emphasis on adult contemporary music began to appear across the country while the format has no particular standard identity most mix stations have rotations consisting largely of pop and rock music from the eight zero s and nine zero s and often the seven zero s with some current material mixed in in addition stations devoted to the pop music of the seven zero s eight zero s and nine zero s on their own have developed as the audiences that grew up with that music grew older and nostalgic for the sounds of their youth classical pop easy listening jazz dance these formats all have small but very loyal audiences in the largest markets most follow formats similar to the above top four zero s freeform aor and oldies except with a different playlist public service stations following these formats tend to be freeform stations classical music radio is just as it sounds radio designed to appeal to the listener of classical music internet classical most classical stations specialize primarily in instrumental classical music and chamber music though there are more special interest classical stations often found through media such as satellite radio or internet radio that carry classical pop music or operatic music easy listening and adult contemporary are related formats that play largely down tempo pop music of various styles the difference is mostly in the era and styles covered easy listening is mostly older music done in the style of standards from the early two zero th century typical artists include johnny mathis and frank sinatra internet streaming combined with big band music and more modern performers in the same style such as celine dion and josh groban while adult contemporary focuses more on newer pop music from the one nine seven zero s on an ancestor to the easy listening format is beautiful music a now rare format though xm features one channel of it called sunny focusing mostly on smooth jazz or classical arrangements of pop music and original compositions in a similar vein jazz stations generally play either traditional jazz forms or smooth jazz the jazz station more than any other except the college station is stereotyped as having a small listenership and a somewhat overly highbrow on air personality and many are college run stations california state university long beach sponsors kjazz eight eight one which has a fairly significant online listenership as well dance music is a niche and so called rhythmic pop stations have had a fierce but not always commercially sustainable following there was a wide spectrum of disco format radio stations during the late seven zero s but virtually all of them died out during the disco backlash wxks in boston is one of the few notable survivors now a clear channel communications owned top four zero station of considerable influence nevertheless there are a large number of dance music stations available both on the internet and on satellite radio mostly specializing in various forms of electronica both major us satellite radio services include disco stations alternative and modern rock rock music has a long and honorable radio tradition going back to djs like wolfman jack and alan freed and as a result variations on rock radio are fairly common the classic rock and oldies formats are discussed above in addition to those however there are several genres of music radio devoted to different aspects of modern rock music alternative rock grew out of the grunge scene of the late eight zero s and early nine zero s and is particularly favored by college radio and adult album alternative stations there is a strong focus on songwriters and bands with an outsider sound or a more sophisticated sound than the three chord wonder cliche meanwhile other stations focus on heavy metal punk rock or the various post punk and pop influenced sounds known collectively as modern rock narrow interest rock stations are particularly common on the internet and satellite radio scenes broken down into genres such as punk metal classic rock indie music and the like there is a general feeling among radio connoisseurs that rock radio is becoming badly watered down by big corporate ownership leading to a considerable do it yourself spirit true country music while stereotyped as rural music the country format is common and popular throughout the united states and in some other countries emphasis is generally on current pop country though stations specializing in older country music have popped up here and there country has been a popular radio format since the early days of music radio country music stations are broken in two catagorys classic country and hot country urban hip hop r urban due to the fact that the styles it represents are largely developed from the street and underground music of urban american blacks in the one nine seven zero s though the music itself has considerable popularity and controversy due to its often nihilistic and hedonistic themes among all ethnic groups and social classes public radio formats some music radio is broadcast by public service organizations such as national public radio or the bbc these usually resemble freeform stations with particular programs for different types of music more popular formats get more popular hours the avant garde programs tend to be pushed to the late night and early morning slots there is a vast variety in the formats used in public broadcasting while the american form represented largely by national public radio and public radio international is generally thought of being dry and academic public broadcasters in other countries have more variety in their programming the bbc for example has eleven national or international radio stations in english alone five of which are devoted primarily to music with roughly another fifty regional and local stations public radio music formats tend to be grouped into broad genres with most public broadcasters offering at least a pop station such as ireland s rte two fm and a classical jazz station in addition college radio stations often operate as public broadcasters promotional usages music radio is also a means of promoting other enterprises such as a record label or ad hoc music events in which the broadcasters have a commercial interest the majority of music radio stations in the united states and canada are commercial stations that sell advertising to pay for their facilities and transmitters in addition many of the larger stations run promotional events such as dance nights concerts and even in the case of some larger stations entire music festivals on air contests and giveaways are common features as are philanthropic programs usually charitable promotions run during holiday seasons song picking music radio has been helped by the development of semi automated song picker programs basically these present the disc jockey with a list of commercially acceptable music selections and other items for the current time slot these give the disc jockey some artistic freedom to select songs promotions jingles etc and yet still assure a cohesive station sound and good audience satisfaction they also reduce a disc jockey s workload allowing him or her to develop news items run the station prepare gags or take call ins while a song is playing the employer may as a result reduce staffing levels and thus trim overhead costs technology while music radio like all radio started out on am it is somewhat unusual at least in developed countries to have a music station on am due to the relatively poor sound bandwidth available in a nine or one zero khz channel as a result since the late six zero s and early seven zero s there has been a wholesale shift to using fm stereo for maximum sound quality the two zero zero khz bands assigned in most countries to fm radio stations are more than adequate to carry a two channeled stereo audio signal along with several subcarriers that serve various purposes nevertheless up through the early nine zero s a large number of stations still programmed substantial amounts of music on the am bands a practice that still continues for some limited formats am stereo in fact though rarely supported on consumer equipment outside of japan can provide near fm quality sound and is required for many stations operating in what in the united states is known as the x band one six two zero one seven one zero khz some fm stations also broadcast sca programming such as multilingual translations and leased content using a subcarrier music radio has progressed behind the microphone over the years originally the disk jockeys were just that people who announced and spun vinyl records high fidelity tape carts from cartridges was the standard through much of the seven zero s and eight zero s phased out in favor of compact disc and eventually computer controlled mp three jukeboxes in some newer studios computer technology looms large in the future of broadcast radio in addition to the obvious use for in studio automation and internet radio it is already widely used for satellite radio to transmit static free programming and ibiquity digital iboc sometimes referred to as hd radio subcarrier transmissions and digital audio broadcasting are both in use in the western hemisphere and europe respectively primarily for transmitting high quality digital music rds information is often broadcast on a subcarrier in the fm bands to transmit station identification and song information as well as information used by regional carriers in some parts of the world to allow automatic frequency hopping between multiple frequencies used by the same station high fidelity music programming is expected to be deployed on the world airwaves using the currently experimental digital radio mondiale system but has yet to see wide acceptance outside of a couple of major european broadcasters such as deutsche welle no international music stations using the technology have yet been launched internet radio generally uses standard streaming protocols with the data most often in mp three realaudio or windows media format increasing numbers of internet radio stations are also using aacplus and ogg vorbis satellite radio tends to use often proprietary streaming protocols along with high quality low bit rate data formats such as aacplus see also list of

ultima online a mmorpg massively multiplayer online role playing game is an online computer role playing game in which a large number of players interact with one another in a virtual world as in all rpgs players assume the role of a character traditionally in a fantasy setting and take control over most of that character s actions mmorpgs are distinguished from single player or small multi player rpgs by the game s persistent world usually hosted by the game s publisher which continues to exist and evolve while the player is away from the game this results in a gameworld which is far more dynamic diverse and realistic than those of other games mmorpgs are immensely popular with several commercial games reporting millions of subscribers south korea boasts the highest subscription numbers with millions of users registered with the more popular games see list of mmorpgs for a list of the most prominent mmorpgs common features though mmorpgs have evolved considerably many of them share various characteristics traditional dungeons and dragons style gameplay including quests monsters and loot a system for character development usually involving levels and experience points commonly abbreviated as exp or xp an economy based on trading of items such as weapons and armor and a regular currency guilds or clans organizations of players whether or not the game supports them game moderators in charge of supervising the world as most mmorpgs are commercial like everquest and world of warcraft players must either purchase the client software for a one time fee or pay a monthly subscription fee to play most major mmorpgs require players do both these things some free of charge mmorpgs do exist though their production quality is generally lower compared to pay to play counterparts history mmorpgs as we define them today have existed since the early one nine nine zero s however they have a history that extends back into the late one nine seven zero s the first gameworlds the beginning of the mmorpg genre can be traced back to text based multi user dungeons or muds the first of which was developed by richard bartle and roy trubshaw in one nine seven eight these were gameworlds hosted on private servers usually at a university sometimes without the knowledge of the system s administrators which players would connect to using a telnet client gameplay was usually similar to tabletop rpgs such as dungeons and dragons by typing commands into a parser players would enter a dungeon fight monsters gain experience and aquire loot similar games quickly developed around the same time for the plato system muds and later descendants such as mushes and moos were wildly different in implementation from one another but shared many basic interface elements for example a player would usually navigate his or her character around the gameworld by typing in compass directions n se etc many muds are still active to this day and the most influential mmorpg designers such as raph koster brad mcquaid mark jacobs and damion schubert began as mud developers and or players early commercial development the first commercial mmorpg although what constitutes massive requires some context when discussing mid one nine eight zero s mainframes was islands of kesmai designed by kelton flinn and john taylor still text based this game became available to consumers in one nine eight four at the cost of one two zero zero per hour via the compuserve online service the first graphical character based interactive environment though not actually an rpg was club caribe first released as habitat which was introduced in one nine eight eight by lucasarts for q link customers on their commodore six four computers users could interact with one another chat and exchange items although very simple its use of online avatars already well established off line by ultima and other games and combining chat with graphics was revolutionary for the time the term avatar for an on screen player character may have originated at lucasarts as part of the habitat project neverwinter nights the first graphical mmorpg the first graphical mmorpg was neverwinter nights by designer don daglow and programmer cathryn mataga which went live on aol for pc owners in one nine nine one and ran through one nine nine seven the project was personally championed and green lighted by aol president steve case both club caribe and neverwinter nights cost six zero zero per hour to play during the early one nine nine zero s commercial use of the internet was limited by nsfnet acceptable use policies consequently early online games like neverwinter nights gemstone iii dragon s gate and federation ii relied upon proprietary services for distribution such as compuserve america online and genie following neverwinter nights was the shadow of yserbius a mmorpg within the sierra network tsn which ran from one nine nine two through one nine nine six the game was produced by joe ybarra the shadow of yserbius was an hourly service although it also offered unlimited service for one one nine nine nine per month until at massive playerbases profit and popularity world wide mmorpgs the realm online was an early successful mmorpg launched by sierra online in one nine nine six the realm online included a basic two dimensional graphics engine and dungeons the monthly fee has since become the standard for most mmorpgs this new pricing model has also been seen as the motivation for business to shift from the hardcore gamer audience who racked up massive fees towards a broader more massive market meridian five nine and ultima online also set the precedent for monthly one zero usd subscriptions a figure that would later gradually increase across the genre these were the first games that used and spread the term massively multiplayer meanwhile commercial online games were becoming extraordinarily popular in south korea nexus the kingdom of the winds designed by jake song began commercial service in one nine nine six and eventually gained over one million subscribers song s next game lineage one nine nine eight was an even bigger success lineage reached millions of subscribers in korea and taiwan and gave developer ncsoft the strength to gain a foothold in the global mmorpg market for the next few years everquest drove mmorpgs into the western mainstream launched in march one nine nine nine by verant interactive and later acquired by sony online entertainment everquest drove fantasy mmorpgs into the western mainstream it was the most commercially successful mmorpg in the united states for five years and was the basis for ten expansions as of december two zero zero five and several derivative games time magazine and other non gaming press featured stories on everquest often focusing on the controversies and social questions inspired by its popularity asheron s call launched later in the year and was another hit rounding out what is sometimes called the original big three of the late one nine nine zero s ultima online everquest and asheron s call yet another fantasy game asheron s call at least featured an original universe the world of everquest was heavily influenced by d sequel to the long running single player console rpg series became the first major console mmorpg as well as the first online game capable of supporting games and servers shared by both console and pc users its practice of randomly selecting servers for new player characters all over the world was controversial and criticized but resulted intentionally in fact in game worlds in which the players regularly spoke different languages also released in two zero zero two the sprite based ragnarok online produced by korean company gravity corporation took asia by storm as lineage had done gravity once claimed that there were one seven million subscribers of the game though this number may not be entirely reliable may two zero zero three saw the release of eve online the first mmorpg released by iceland based developer crowd control productions ccp eve online distinguished itself by placing all players in a single world without sharding the servers to distribute player load based in a fictional galaxy two four zero zero zero years in the future eve online drew a small but loyal fan base that has grown over time according to the game s website the user base for eve online has broken the one zero zero k mark and the game continues to break its own peak concurrent user pcu record which stands at two three eight one one as of two seven february two zero zero six in november two zero zero four sony online entertainment expected to dominate the market when they released the sequel to their phenomonally successful everquest everquest ii to keep from competing with themselves sony began to offer a flat monthly rate to play all sony mmorpgs such as everquest star wars galaxies and the new everquest ii however much of sony s potential customer base was drawn to blizzard entertainment s world of warcraft wow released in that same month at present wow is one of the most played games in north america and one of the most played american mmorpgs with a total of over five million customers worldwide with the release of these newer games subscriptions began to decline for old games such as lineage ii and everquest one the release of guild wars in april two zero zero five represented ncsoft s investment in the possible profitability of an online rpg with a one time fee guild wars did not share many of the distinguishing features of typical mmorpgs such as the massive persistent game world the subscription fee the large time investment required to play and the largely server dependent software architecture and as such was termed a competitive online role playing game corpg by the developers another korean mmorpg maplestory a side scroller developed by wizet likewise contains free gameplay however it covers its costs through purchasable game enhancements due to its free nature the game is said to have more than three zero million players in all of its many versions with the majority of them from east asia on august four two zero zero five the chinese government announced a ban on all violent gameplay for minors under one eight chinese officials defined violent as any game that involves player vs player combat a common feature among mmorpgs later in august the same year the chinese government imposed online gaming curbs so players will gain experience and items in game at a decreased and decreasing rate until it hits zero after five hours of consecutive gameplay after which the player must log off for five hours to get the full rate back academic attention mmorpgs have begun to attract significant academic attention notably in the fields of economics and psychology edward castronova specializes in the study of virtual worlds muds mmogs and similar concepts most of his writings including virtual worlds a first hand account of market and society on the cyberian frontier two zero zero one have examined relationships between real world economies and synthetic economies with the growing popularity of the genre a growing number of psychologists and sociologists study the actions and interactions of the players in such games one of the more famous of these researchers is sherry turkle another researcher is nick yee who has surveyed more than three five zero zero zero mmorpg players over the past few years focusing on psychological and sociological aspects of these games his research can be found at the daedalus project independent development daimonin is one of the independent efforts to create a free mmorpg many small teams of programmers and artists have tried to create their own mmorpgs the average mmorpg project takes three to four years and large investments of money to create independent development or game development not run by any company usually takes longer due to lack of developer s time manpower or money additionally the long term lack of funding required for running mmorpg servers may lead to the abandonment of the project sometimes these independent games are free to play but will confer in game privileges to paying customers the best established independent projects are awplanet daimonin endless online and planeshift daimonin and planeshift are entirely open source the developers of endless online have released technical development information with details about their coding the worldforge project has been active since one nine nine eight and formed a community of independent developers who are working on creating framework for a number of open source mmorpgs browser based mmorpgs with the success of the mmorpg genre in recent years several multiplayer games played in web browsers have also begun using the mmorpg moniker this largely text based sub genre developed from old bbs games and pre dates the modern idea of an mmorpg browser based mmorpgs are usually simpler games than their stand alone counterparts typically involving turn based play and simple strategies e g build a large army then attack other players for gold though there are many interesting variations on the popular themes to be found many of these games are more like turn based strategy games or wargames than role playing games in planetarion players control planets and fleets of ships in kings of chaos the player commands an army rather than a single player character in pardus the player controls a character who owns a spaceship and gains experience points through trading or fighting in a way similar to the classic game elite legend of the green dragon is an example of a text based mmorpg accessible with a web browser one of the earliest examples of a browser based mmorpg is archmage which dates back to early one nine nine nine currently an extremely popular browser based mmorpg kings of chaos boasts a player population numbering in the hundreds of thousands its popularity is primarily fuelled by a reciprocal link clicking system where users give each other more soldiers by clicking on their friends unique links taking advantage of the small world phenomenon to spread word of the game across the world some examples of click based mmorpg s are legend of the green dragon and world of phaos whose code is open source allowing anyone to create their own game server another browser based mmorpg kingdom of loathing largely parodies other games some of the more popular of these have become profitable through user subscriptions not all browser based mmorpgs are turn based text games more recently faster computers and the java programming language have allowed the introduction of graphical browser based mmorpgs such as runescape produced by jagex which are more similar to standalone mmorpgs genre challenges most mmorpgs require significant development resources to overcome the logistical hurdles associated with such large production efforts online games require virtual worlds significant hardware requirements e g servers and bandwidth and dedicated support staff despite the efforts of developers cognizant of these issues reviewers often cite non optimal populations such as overcrowding or under populated worlds lag and poor support as problems of games in this genre these problems tend to be worse for free mmorpgs peer to peer mmorpgs could theoretically scale better because peers share the resource load but practical issues such as asymmetrical network bandwidth and cpu hungry rendering engines make peer to peer mmorpgs a difficult proposition additionally they become vulnerable to other problems such as cheating several mmorpgs have suffered through technical difficulties through the first few days or weeks after launch early successes such as ultima online and everquest managed to pass through this stage with little permanent damage few games may have significant failures leading ultimately to their demise if they launch too early and contain frequent bug fixes downtime or structural game changes that may discourage players from continuing to play the game due to these problems games such as anarchy online and world war ii online struggled to regain good press after their first month and gained good press after stabilizing their servers dark age of camelot and city of heroes showed hardly any signs of such difficulties cheating cheating is a major challenge for the game developers as it is done in many ways exploiting is a form of cheating involving the use of a flaw in the game mechanics to gain unfair advantage depending on the nature of the exploit game developers can fix the exploits within hours or even minutes through patches and updates although some holes last weeks or months before they are detected or reported even when fixed exploiting can still be an issue as exploiters may still have the advantage they gained before the patch was released depending on the seriousness of the exploit a rollback may be needed just to counter the effects the exploits had external or three rd party programs are another type of cheat they can be used to automate legitimate actions that were intended to be accomplished by the users themselves often with such efficiency that it provides a huge advantage botting is a term for a player using a script that could automate progress through the game without them actually playing the game for themselves this could be done through a simple macro program which records keystrokes and mouse movements or scripting program that could make smart keystrokes such as ac tools farmers if they are unable to exploit loop holes in the game will use such methods to harvest materials or gold from the game world right around the clock requiring a little more talent on the cheaters part along with some rudimentry social engineering some third party programs are released with code in them to capture and relay account details back to the author enabling them to steal virtual possesions from the account or impersonate the rightful owner to perpetrate confidence tricks and other scams these trojans often masquerade as a free utility to help with some common game related task such as character template design even more subtle methods are known to be used to gain an edge and as these require the most skill they can be hard to detect depending on the way the game handles certain aspects of gameplay the client or components thereof can be modified either on disk directly in memory or on the wire as data passes between the client and server all the while the server does not verify the veracity of client data or ideally take care of important calculations server side this can be used to modify values such as character health or armour speed up movement or subtly change other non trivial aspects of the game to the cheater s advantage there are programs that have been designed to prevent external programs from running during a game such as gameguard the integrity of client files can also be checked each time you load the game although of course some gamers have found ways to bypass or disable these protection programs private servers single client based graphic mmorpgs may have private servers or server emulators private servers are mostly run by volunteers therefore most of them are free however some private servers may wish for people to donate money sometimes in exchange for a bonus in the game private servers remain markedly less popular than the official servers with player numbers in the hundreds not thousands eqemu is a server emulator for everquest others exist for world of warcraft lineage ii ultima online and many other mmorpgs in china as well as many other asian countries the use of private servers is more prevalent most chinese mmorpg players are aware of the existence of private servers and according to statistics more people prefer private servers than official servers the reasons for this are the relatively high fees for official servers and the availability of one zero zero mb s fiber optic internet connections which can be as cheap as us three zero a month also the costs of running a server in china are also remarkably low in one instance a private server had more than five zero zero zero zero players registered some even have one zero zero zero accounts in one day the opening day among such cases are mu online which is one of the most popular private server games in the world with a total of over

video game genres massively multiplayer online role playing games this article is about multiplication in mathematics for multiplication in music see multiplication music redirects here this symbol is also used in a botanical hybrid name in mathematics multiplication is an arithmetic operation which is the inverse of division and in elementary arithmetic can be interpreted as repeated addition in its simplest form multiplication is the sum of a list of identical numbers for example the product seven four is seven seven seven seven the numbers being multiplied are called the multiplicand and multiplier or the factors notation multiplication can be denoted in several equivalent ways all of the following mean five times two five two five two five two five two five two five two five two five two five two five two the asterisk is often used on computers because it is a symbol on every keyboard but it is rarely used when writing math by hand this usage originated in the fortran programming language frequently multiplication is implied by juxtaposition rather than shown in a notation this is standard in algebra taking forms like five x and xy this is potentially confusing if variables are permitted to have names longer than one letter the notation is not used with numbers alone five two never means five two if the terms are not written out individually then the product may be written with an ellipsis to mark out the missing terms as with other series operations like sums thus the product of all the natural numbers from one to one zero zero can be written one cdot two cdot ldots cdot nine nine cdot one zero zero this can also be written with the ellipsis vertically placed in the middle of the line as one cdot two cdot cdots cdot nine nine cdot one zero zero alternatively the product can be written with the product symbol which derives from the capital letter pi in the greek alphabet this is defined as prod x x cdot x cdot x cdot cdots cdot x cdot x the subscript gives the symbol for a dummy variable i in our case and its lower value m the superscript gives its upper value so for example prod left one right left one right cdot left one right cdot left one right cdot left one right cdot left one right one may also consider products of infinitely many terms these are called infinite products notationally we would replace n above by the infinity symbol the product of such a series is defined as the limit of the product of the first n terms as n grows without bound that is prod x lim prod x one can similarly replace m with negative infinity and prod infty x i left lim prod m x i right cdot left lim prod n x i right for some integer m provided both limits exist definition as for what multiplication means the product of two whole numbers n and m is mn sum n m this is just a shorthand for saying add m to itself n times expanding the above to make its meaning more clear m n m m m m such that there are n m s added together so for instance five two five five one zero two five two two two two two one zero four three four four four one two m six m m m m m m using this definition it is easy to prove some interesting properties of multiplication as the first two examples above hint at the order in which two numbers are multiplied does not matter this is called the commutative property and it turns out to be true in general that for any two numbers x and y x y y x multiplication also has what is called the associative property the associative property means that for any three numbers x y and z x y z x y z note from algebra the parentheses mean that the operations inside the parentheses must be done before anything outside the parentheses is done multiplication also has what is called a distributive property with respect to the addition because x y z xy xz also of interest is that any number times one is equal to itself thus one x x and this is called the identity property in this regard the number one is known as the multiplicative identity what about zero well we have m zero m m m m where there are zero m s added together the sum of zero m s is zero so m zero zero no matter what m is as long as it is finite multiplication with negative numbers also requires a little thought first consider negative one for any positive integer m one m one one one m this is an interesting fact that shows that any negative number is just negative one multiplied by a positive number so multiplication with any integers can be represented by multiplication of whole numbers and one s all that remains is to explicitly define one one one one one one in this way the multiplication of any two integers is defined the definitions can be extended to larger and larger sets of numbers first to vulgar fractions called the rational numbers then to infinitely long decimals called real numbers and then to the complex numbers students are sometimes mystified when told that the result of multiplying no numbers is one a formal recursive definition of multiplication can be given by the rules x zero zero x y x x y one where x is a real number and y is a natural number once multiplication has been defined for natural numbers it can be extended to include integers and then to real and complex numbers computation for fast ways to compute products of large numbers see multiplication algorithms some algorithms are suitable for multiplying numbers using pencil and paper most such as lattice multiplication require a multiplication table of memorized or consulted products of small numbers typically any two numbers from

quickly dried before the plant develops the term malt refers to several products of the process the grains to which this process has been applied for example malted barley the sugar derived from such grains which is heavy in maltose such as baker s malt a product based on malted milk similar to a malted milkshake i e malts whisky or beer can also be called malt as in alfred edward housman s aphorism malt does more than milton can to justify god s ways to man homebrewing malt extracts liquid in a can and spray dried malt is used to make beer whisky and malt vinegar malting grains develops the enzymes that are required to modify the grain s starches into sugars barley is the most common malt because of its high enzyme content other grains may be malted although the resulting malt may not have sufficient enzymatic content to convert its own starch content fully and efficiently the typical pale malt malting process is as follows the fresh raw grains are washed and soaked for a period of time to begin germination a constant moisture is held to promote germination and growth of the the acrospire is allowed to grow to a length equal to the grain or a little less about four six days for barley the green malt is then kilned at one zero zero f to one two zero f three eight c to four nine c for about two four hours and then at one four zero f to one six zero f six zero c to seven one c until the moisture content is less than six darker brewing malts are sometimes kilned in different ways to promote different characteristics reference make your own malt brew your own

structures from individual units laid in and bound together by mortar the common materials of masonry construction are brick stone such as marble granite travertine limestone concrete block glass block and tile masonry is generally a highly durable form of construction however the materials used the quality of the mortar and workmanship and the pattern the units are laid in can strongly affect the durability of the overall masonry construction a brick wall built using the flemish bond applications masonry is commonly used for the walls of buildings retaining walls and monuments brick is the most common type of masonry and may be either weight bearing or a veneer concrete block masonry is rapidly gaining in popularity as a comparable material blocks most of which have hollow cores offer various possibilities in masonry construction generally providing great compressive strength and they re generally best suited to structures with light transverse loading when the cores remain unfilled filling some or all of the cores with concrete stone or steel reinforcement typically rebar offers much greater tensile and lateral strength to structures advantages the use of materials such as brick and stone can increase the thermal mass of a building giving increased comfort in the heat of summer and the cold of winter and can be ideal for passive solar applications brick typically will not require painting and so can provide a structure with reduced life cycle costs although sealing appropriately will reduce potential spalling due to frost damage concrete block of the non decorative variety generally is painted or stuccoed if exposed the appearance especially when well crafted can impart an impression of solidity and permanence disadvantages extreme weather may cause degradation of the surface due to frost damage this type of damage is common with certain types of brick though relatively rare with concrete block if non concrete clay based brick is to be used care should be taken to select bricks suitable for the climate in question masonry must be built upon a firm foundation usually reinforced concrete to avoid settling and potentially cracking if expansive soils such as adobe clay are present this foundation may need to be quite elaborate and the services of a qualified structural engineer may be required the high weight increases structural requirements especially in earthquake prone areas structural limitations masonry boasts an impressive compressive strength vertical loads but is much lower in tensile strength twisting or stretching unless reinforced the tensile strength of masonry walls can be strengthened by thickening the wall or by building masonry piers vertical columns or ribs at intervals where practical steel reinforcement also can be introduced vertically and or horizontally to greatly increase tensile strength though this is most commonly done with poured walls one technique used to boost the tensile strength of poured concrete is called prestressing this involves stretching steel rods and essentially pouring concrete around them to form heavy construction elements such as bridge girders and hollowcore plank after the concrete is cured the steel rods are cut off at the ends and it contracts just enough to pull the concrete inward increase its density slightly and greatly increase its strength against these sideways loads veneer masonry brick veneer construction has strength imparted by a framework of wood or a rough masonry wall of other material over which is placed a layer of bricks for weatherproofing and providing a finished appearance the brick veneer wall is connected to the structural walls by brick ties metal strips that are attached to the structural wall as well as the mortar joints of the brick veneer wall there typically is an air gap between the brick veneer wall and the structural wall as clay brick is not completely waterproof the structural wall has a water resistant surface usually tar paper and weep holes are left at the base of the brick veneer wall to ventilate the air gap veneer walls often are structurally superior to solid un reinforced brick walls because the core can be constructed of block reinforced by steel and or poured concrete block also may offer opportunities to run utilities within the wall if some block cores can be left unfilled for this purpose most insulated buildings that utilize concrete block brick veneers or some combination thereof feature interior insulation in the form of fiberglass batts between wooden wall studs or rigid insulation boards covered with plaster or drywall in most climates this insulation is much more effective on the exterior of the wall allowing the building interior to take advantage of the aforementioned thermal mass of the masonry this technique does however require some sort of weather resistant exterior surface over the insulation and consequently is generally more expensive dry set masonry dry set masonry supports a rustic log bridge where it provides a well drained support for the log this will increase its service life the strength of a masonry wall is not entirely dependent on the bond between the building material and the mortar the friction between the interlocking blocks of masonry is often strong enough to provide a great deal of strength on its own the blocks sometimes have grooves or other surface features added to enhance this interlocking and some dry set masonry structures forego mortar all together solid masonry solid masonry without steel reinforcement tends to have very limited applications in modern wall construction while such walls can be quite economical and suitable in some applications susceptibility to earthquakes and collapse is a major issue solid unreinforced masonry walls tend to be low and thick as a consequence brick solid brick masonry is made of two or more layers of bricks with the units running horizontally called stretcher bricks bound together with bricks running transverse to the wall called header bricks each row of bricks is known as a course the pattern of headers and stretchers employed gives rise to different bonds such as the common bond with every sixth course composed of headers the english bond and the flemish bond with alternating stretcher and header bricks present on every course there are no significant utilitarian differences between most bonds but the appearance of the finished wall is affected vertically staggered bonds tend to be somewhat stronger and less prone to major cracking than a non staggered bond uniformity and rusticity the selection of the brick used especially for color will affect the appearance of the final surface in buildings built during the one nine seven zero s a high degree of uniformity of brick and accuracy in masonry was typical in later periods this style was thought to be too sterile so attempts were made to emulate older rougher work some brick surfaces are made to look particularly rustic by including burnt bricks which have a darker color or an irregular shape others may use antique salvage bricks or new bricks may be artificially aged by applying various surface treatments the attempts at rusticity of the late two zero th century have been carried forward by masons specializing in a free artistic style where the courses are intentionally not straight instead weaving to form more organic impressions serpentine masonry a crinkle crankle wall is a brick wall that follows a serpentine path rather than a straight line this type of wall is more resistant to toppling than a straight wall so much so that it may be made of a single thickness of unreinforced brick and so despite its longer length may be more economical than a straight wall concrete block blocks of cinder concrete cinder blocks or breezeblocks ordinary concrete concrete blocks or hollow tile are generically known as concrete masonry units cmu s they usually are much larger than ordinary bricks and so are much faster to lay for a wall of a given size furthermore cinder and tile blocks have much lower water absorption rates than brick they often are used as the structural core for veneered brick masonry or are used alone for the walls of factories garages and other industrial buildings where appearance is not a significant factor such blocks often receive a stucco surface for decoration surface bonding cement sometimes is used in this application and can impart extra strength to a block wall the primary advantage of concrete blocks in comparison to smaller clay based bricks is that a cmu structure can be reinforced by either fully grouting the voids or inserting vertical lengths of rebar and using grout to hold them in place in this manner a cmu wall can be built much stronger than typical masonry walls some concrete blocks are colored and some employ a split face a technique that results in two blocks being manufactured as one unit and later split into two this gives the blocks a rough face replicating the appearance of natural quarried stone such as brownstone examples of splitface block as well as other types of cmus and brick can be seen here for applications such as roadway sound control walls the patterns may be complex and even artistic decorative cmus have gained in popularity also with units featuring a glazed burnished or glossy finish emerging as innovative new options in interior veneers decorative cmus most often appear in financial institutions schools and other municipal or professional settings were an aesthetic but durable or a virtually marbled product is appropriate such blocks usually have a smooth finish and can have a visible internal aggregates a solid uniformly colored glaze or a visible aggregates protected by a clear sealant stone stone blocks used in masonry can be dressed or rough stone masonry utilizing dressed stones is known as ashlar masonry whereas masonry using irregularly shaped stones is known as rubble masonry both rubble and ashlar masonry can be laid in courses rows of even height through the careful selection or cutting of stones but a great deal of stone masonry is uncoursed sometimes river rock ovate shaped smooth stones is used as a veneer this type of material is not favored for solid masonry as it requires a great amount of mortar and can lack intrinsic structural strength growing in popularity among builders and homeowners are manufactured stone veneers companies such as cultured stone a division of owens corning and boulder creek stone pull natural stones from quarries around the world create molds from them and recreate those stones with concrete to the casual observer and even many masons there is no visual difference between veneers of natural and manufactured stone gabions gabions are rectangular wire baskets usually of zinc protected steel that are filled with fractured stone of medium size these will act a single unit and are stacked with set backs to form a revetment or retaining wall they have the advantage of being both well drained and flexible and so resistant to flood water flow from above frost damage and soil flow there expected useful life is only as long as the wire they are composed of and if used in severe climates such as shore side in a salt water environment must be made of appropriate corrosion resistant wire bagged concrete a low grade concrete may be placed in woven plastic sacks similar to that used for sandbags and then emplaced the sacks are then watered and the emplacement then becomes a series of artificial stones that conform to one another and to adjacent soil and structures this conformation makes them resistant to displacement the sack becomes non functional and eventually disintegrates this type of masonry is frequently used to protect the entrances and exits of water conduits where a road passes over a stream or dry wash it is also used to

mickey mouse mickey mouse first created november one eight one nine two eight is a comic animal cartoon character who has become a symbol for the walt disney company created in one nine two eight by walt disney and ub iwerks the mouse has evolved from being simply a character in animated cartoons and comic strips to become one of the most recognizable symbols in the world walt disney himself voiced mickey mouse from one nine two eight until one nine four six when sound effects man james g macdonald took over the role mickey has been voiced since one nine eight three by wayne allwine macdonald s former apprentice the icon mickey s most recognizable look has him wearing red shorts and yellow shoes mickey mouse may be the most recognized symbol of america except for the flag for some he symbolizes the country s cultural imperialism the spread of its culture to other places in the world for others he represents happiness and innocence he is the symbol for the walt disney company and in many ways walt disney himself it was said by lillian disney his wife that over the years mickey and walt grew together and were mirrors of each other s personality they both started off mischievous but as they grew older preferred to step out of the spotlight and observe others work their magic president jimmy carter once said mickey mouse is the symbol of goodwill surpassing all languages and cultures when one sees mickey mouse they see happiness the mickey icon a three circle silhouette of mickey s head serves as the logo for most of disney s subsidiaries which contain the name disney andy warhol s portrait the art of mickey mouse used warhol s famous pop art techniques on the classic mouse creation and debut mickey s first appearance in plane crazy mickey was created by ub iwerks as a replacement for oswald the lucky rabbit an earlier star created by the disney studio oswald had also been created by ub iwerks with limited input from walt disney for charles mintz of universal studios in fact mickey closely resembled oswald in his early appearances however disney received an unpleasant surprise when he asked mintz for a larger budget for his popular oswald series in reply mintz announced he had hired the bulk of disney s staff but that disney could keep doing the oswald series as long as he agreed to a budget cut and went on the payroll mintz owned oswald and thought he had disney over a barrel angrily disney refused the deal and returned to california to produce the final oswald cartoons he contractually owed mintz disney was dismayed at the betrayal by his staff but determined to restart from scratch the new disney studio initially consisted of iwerks and a loyal apprentice artist les clark one lesson disney learned from the experience was to thereafter always make sure that he owned all rights to the characters produced by his company in order for walt and his older brother and business partner roy to keep their company active new characters had to be created to star in their subsequent animated shorts one day during a train ride walt desperately wanted to come up with a money making character to replace the one he lost oswald he had visions of a mouse in the back of his head he had previously made silent cartoon shorts with animated mice he wanted to name his new creation mortimer mouse but his wife lillian marie bounds thought the name was too pretentious so he changed it to mickey mouse the name mortimer would later be used for a character in a mickey cartoon it has been suggested that walt disney was influenced by an actual mouse that he almost tamed by feeding it crumbs on his desk at the laugh o gram studio we felt that the public and especially the children like animals that are cute and little i think we are rather indebted to charlie chaplin for the idea we wanted something appealing and we thought of a tiny bit of a mouse that would have something of the wistfulness of chaplin a little fellow trying to do the best he could when people laugh at mickey mouse it s because he s so human and that is the secret of his popularity i only hope that we don t lose sight of one thing that it was all started by a mouse walt disney mickey and minnie mouse mickey s girlfriend debuted in the cartoon short plane crazy first released on may one five one nine two eight the short was co directed by walt disney and ub iwerks iwerks was also the main animator for this short and reportedly spent six weeks working on it in fact ub iwerks was the main animator for every disney short released in one nine two eight and one nine two nine he left disney in one nine three zero in order to form his own studio and introduced flip the frog in the first sound cartoon made in color hugh harman and rudolf ising also assisting disney during one nine two eight and one nine two nine these two had already signed their contracts with charles mintz but he was still in the process of forming his new studio and so for the time being they were still employed by disney this short would be the last they animated under this somewhat awkward situation the plot of plane crazy was fairly simple mickey is apparently trying to become an aviator in emulation of charles lindbergh after building his own aircraft he proceeds to ask minnie to join him for its first flight during which he repeatedly and unsuccessfully attempts to kiss her eventually resorting to force minnie then parachutes out of the plane while distracted by her mickey loses control of the plane this becomes the beginning of an out of control flight that results in a series of humorous situations and eventually in the crash landing of the aircraft a non anthropomorphic cow that briefly becomes a passenger in the aircraft is believed to be clarabelle cow making her debut mickey as portrayed in plane crazy was mischievous amorous and has often been described as a rogue modern audiences have occasionally commented on this version of mickey as being somewhat more complex and consequently more interesting than his later self at the time of its first release however plane crazy apparently failed to impress audiences and to add insult to injury walt could not find a distributor though understandably disappointed walt went on to produce a second mickey short the gallopin gaucho early landmarks image pa one nine zero zero nine nine jpg first encounter with black peg leg pete the gallopin gaucho was again co directed by walt disney and ub iwerks with the latter serving as the sole animator in this case the short was intended as a parody of douglas fairbanks s the gaucho a film first released on november two one one nine two seven following the original film the events of the short take place in the pampas of argentina the gaucho of the title was mickey himself he is first seen riding on a rhea instead of a horse as would be expected or an ostrich as often reported he soon encounters cantina argentina apparently serving as the local bar and restaurant mickey proceeds to enter the establishment and take a seat he apparently just wants to relax with some drinking and tobacco smoking also present at the establishment are black pete later renamed peg leg pete or just pete a wanted outlaw and fellow customer for the time being and minnie mouse the barmaid and dancer of the establishment at the time performing a tango both customers soon begin to flirt with minnie and to rival one another at some point pete proceeds in kidnapping minnie and attempts to escape on his horse mickey gives chase on his rhea he soon catches up to his rival and they proceed to fight with swords mickey emerges the victor of this joust the finale of the short has mickey and minnie riding the rhea into the distance in later interviews iwerks would comment that mickey as featured in the gallopin gaucho was intended to be a swashbuckler an adventurer modeled after fairbanks himself this short marks the first encounter between mickey and black pete a character already established as an antagonist in both the alice comedies and the oswald series based on mickey and minnie acting as strangers to each other before the finale it was presumably intended to feature their original acquaintance to each other as well modern audiences have commented that all three characters seem to be coming out of rough lower class backgrounds that little resemble their later versions consequently the short is arguably of some historical significance at the time of its original production though walt again failed to find a distributor it would be first released on december three zero one nine two eight following the release of another mickey short reportedly mickey was at first thought to be much too similar to oswald and this resulted in the apparent lack of interest in him walt would soon start to contemplate ways to distinguish the mickey mouse series from his previous work and that of his rivals the result of his contemplations would be the third mickey short to be produced the second to be released and the first to really draw the attention of the audiences steamboat willie addition of sound to the series mickey in steamboat willie steamboat willie was first released on november one eight one nine two eight it was co directed by walt disney and ub iwerks iwerks again served as the head animator assisted by johnny cannon les clark wilfred jackson and dick lundy this short was intended as a parody of buster keaton s steamboat bill jr first released on may one two of the same year despite the fact this was not the first mickey cartoon made or released it is still considered by some as mickey mouse s true debut the cartoon is often listed in history books as being the first animated film ever to feature a synchronized sound music and dialogue track but fleischer studios headed by brothers dave and max fleischer had already released some sound cartoons using the deforest system in the mid one nine two zero s as a matter of fact disney got the idea of making a sound cartoon after watching an aesop s film fable cartoon entitled dinner time this series was distriubuted by path and produced by paul terry steamboat willie was however the first sound cartoon to achieve wide recognition animation historians have long debated who had served as the composer for the film s original music this role has been variously attributed to wilfred jackson carl stalling and bert lewis but identification remains uncertain walt disney himself acted as voice actor for both mickey and minnie the script had mickey serving aboard steamboat willie under captain pete at first he is seen piloting the steamboat while whistling then pete arrives to take over piloting and angrily throws him out of the boat s bridge they soon have to stop for cargo to be transferred on board almost as soon as they leave minnie arrives she was apparently supposed to be their only passenger but was late to board mickey manages to pick her up from the river shore minnie accidentally drops her sheet music for the popular folk song turkey in the straw a goat which was among the animals transported on the steamboat proceeds to eat the sheet music consequently mickey and minnie use its tail to turn it into a phonograph which is playing the tune through the rest of the short mickey uses various other animals as musical instruments later audiences have often described those scenes as humorously exaggerated examples of animal cruelty captain pete is eventually disturbed by all this noise and places mickey back to work mickey is reduced to peeling potatoes for the rest of the trip a parrot attempts to make fun of him but is then thrown to the river by mickey this served as the final scene of this short audiences at the time of steamboat willie s release were reportedly impressed by its use of sound for comedic purposes sound films were still considered innovative the first feature length movie with dialogue sequences the jazz singer starring al jolson was released on october six one nine two seven within a year of its success most united states movie theaters had installed sound film equipment walt disney apparently intended to take advantage of this new trend and arguably managed to succeed most other cartoon studios were still producing silent products and so were unable to effectively act as competition to disney as a result mickey would soon become the most prominent animated character of the time walt disney soon worked on adding sound to both plane crazy and the gallopin gaucho which had originally been silent releases and their new release added to mickey s success and popularity a fourth mickey short was also put into production it was the barn dance roles mickey as a suitor the barn dance first released on march one four one nine two nine would be the first of twelve mickey shorts released during that year it was directed by walt disney with ub iwerks as the head animator the barn dance of the title is the occasion which brings together minnie and her two suitors mickey and pete the latter two and their vehicles are first seen arriving at minnie s house in an attempt to pick her up for the dance mickey turns up in his horse cart while pete in a newly purchased automobile minnie initially chooses pete to drive her to the dance but the automobile unexpectedly breaks down she resorts to accepting mickey s invitation they are later seen dancing together but mickey proves to be a rather clumsy dancer as he repeatedly steps on minnie s feet she consequently turns down his invitation for a second dance she instead accepts that of pete who proves to be a better dancing partner mickey then attempts to solve his problem by placing a balloon in his shorts that apparently helps him to be light on his feet and he proceeds to ask minnie for another dance she accepts and is surprised to find his dancing skills to have apparently improved pete soon discovers mickey s trick and points it out to minnie minnie is visibly disgusted by this attempt at deception as a result she leaves mickey and resumes dancing with pete in the finale mickey is reduced to crying on the floor this short was the first to feature its three main characters as parts of a love triangle it is notable for featuring mickey turned down by minnie in favor of pete it is also an unusual appearance of the pete previously depicted as a menacing villain he is portrayed here as a well mannered gentleman in addition mickey was not depicted as a hero but as a rather ineffective young suitor in his sadness and crying over his failure mickey appears unusually emotional and vulnerable it has been commented however that this only serves to add to the audiences empathy for the character first gloved appearance ever wonder why we always wear these white gloves various characters with minor variations mickey in gloves the opry house first released on march two eight one nine two nine would be the second short released during the year it cast mickey as the owner of a small theater or opera house according to the title mickey performs a vaudeville show all by himself acts include his impersonation of a snake charmer his dressing in drag and performing a belly dance his caricature of a hasidic jew and for the finale a piano performance minnie did not appear in person in this short instead a poster of her can be seen which introduces her as a member of the yankee doodle girls apparently a group of female performers the only other recurring character to appear in the short is known as kat nipp apparently a play on the word catnip this would be his debut he would appear in two more shorts during the year as a minor antagonist this short featured no dialogue and consequently its humor relies in a long series of visual gags the musical pieces accompanying them notably included yankee doodle and georges bizet s carmen more notably this short introduced mickey s gloves mickey can be seen wearing them in most of his subsequent appearances supposedly one reason for adding the white gloves was to allow audiences to distinguish the characters hands when they appeared against their bodies as both were black mickey did not appear in color until the band concert in one nine three five depiction as a regular mouse when the cat s away first released on april one one one nine two nine would be the third mickey short to be released that year it was essentially a remake of one of the alice comedies alice rattled by rats which had been first released on january one five one nine two six kat nipp makes his second appearance though his name is given as tom cat this describes his being a tom cat and the character should not be confused with the co star of the tom and jerry series he is seen getting drunk on alcoholic beverages then he leaves his house to go hunting in his absence an army of mice invade his house in search of food among them are mickey and minnie who proceed to turn this gathering into a party this short is unusual in depicting mickey and minnie as having the size and partly the behavior of regular mice the set standard both before and after this short was to depict them as having the size of a rather short human being on another note it has been commented that since this short was released during the prohibition era the alcoholic beverages would probably have been products of bootlegging mickey as a soldier firsts first encounter with horace horsecollar mickey returned to civilian life with the plow boy first released on may nine one nine two nine as the title implies he was depicted as a farmer alongside minnie he is first seen with his horse while ploughing a field then minnie comes along with her cow she has mickey milk the cow for her as he does the cow starts licking him in an apparent sign of affection mickey does not seem pleased and replies by rolling up its muzzle with its own tongue mickey eventually manages to present minnie with a full bucket of milk and proceeds to kiss her minnie s reply to this sign of affection is knocking his head with the bucket at some point the horse is stung by a bee panics and starts galloping by the time the horse calms down again the plough has been broken in the finale mickey resorts to using a pig as a plough curiously the short is considered mainly notable for the livestock it featured minnie s cow is considered to be clarabelle cow making her second appearance and mickey s plow horse is considered to be horace horsecollar making his debut though depicted as non anthropomorphic animals during this short later that same year both would become as anthropomorphic as their former owners first speaking appearance mickey spanks a hot dog in the karnival kid one nine two nine during his first eight appearances mickey would whistle laugh cry and otherwise vocally express himself but he would not actually speak until his ninth appearance this short was the karnival kid first released on may two three one nine two nine mickey s first spoken words were hot dogs the short featured mickey selling hot dogs at a carnival much of the humor in this short came from the interaction between mickey and his hot dogs with the latter tending to act like actual dogs in relation to their owner trainer three other recurring characters of the series also appear the first of them was clarabelle cow in a cameo the second was kat nipp making his third and last appearance a barker at the carnival he briefly gets into an argument with mickey the third was mickey s recurring love interest minnie mouse the shimmy dancer of the carnival having purchased one of mickey s hot dogs she is surprised to see it run away the short ends at night time mickey apparently attempts to draw minnie s attention by playing guitar singing outside her window he only manages to draw the attention of two alley cats who decide to join him and then that of an irate neighbour of minnie who starts throwing things at these three annoyances in an attempt to silence them this marks the finale of the short first singing appearance this following mickey short to be released was mickey s choo choo first released on june two zero one nine two nine as the title implies mickey is depicted as the engineer in charge of an unusually anthropomorphic locomotive his only passenger seems to be minnie cast as a fiddle player for this short at some point mickey loses control of the locomotive clarabelle has another brief appearance as a cow running out of its way it was soon followed by mickey s follies first released on june two six one nine two nine the short featured a barnyard show including various numbers a female pig singing opera is considered to be patricia pig making her only animated appearance she would be a recurring character early in mickey s comic strip series but the short is more notable for mickey s main act it has mickey singing minnie s yoo hoo for the first time this humorous little song is considered to have a historical importance of its own for one thing the guy they call little mickey mouse for the first time addresses an audience to explain that he has got a sweetie who is neither fat nor skinny and proudly proclaims that she s my little minnie mouse for another this would serve as the new theme song for the series the music to the song was written by carl stalling and the lyrics by walt disney finally animation historians have pointed that it seems to be the first song with original lyrics created by walt s studio from comedy to musical the ninth mickey short to be released that year was the jazz fool first released on july five one nine two nine the title was probably intended to be reminiscent of both the jazz singer and also the singing fool first released on september one nine one nine two eight both musical films featured al jolson as their star and had proved commercially successful this film followed the originals in having minimal plot and focusing on musical performances mickey and his friend horace horsecollar the latter in his first anthropomorphic appearance are cast as the sole two performers of mickey s big road show the former plays the piano and the later the xylophone the soundtrack of the film reportedly contained elements of both ragtime and dixieland jazz this short is considered to be representative of a change of focus early in the series the preceding shorts already featured their share of song and dance numbers as part of their comedic plots many of the following ones can better be described as animated song and dance shows with little to no plot first encounter with ghosts this was not the case however with the next mickey short to be released haunted house first released on august one one nine two nine the short begins at night time mickey is seen caught up in a storm with an umbrella serving as his only protection from the rain mickey is naturally seeking a refuge for himself he soon discovers an apparently deserted house and proceeds to enter it the door suddenly shuts behind him and seems to be locked mickey is somewhat unnerved and his encounters with bats and large spiders only increase his growing fear at this point mickey finds out that the house is indeed inhabited by ghosts in skeleton form mickey has entered a haunted house the figure of the grim reaper orders him to play music to entertain them mickey is surprised but clearly too scared to argue with it skeletons are seen dancing to mickey s tune at some point mickey attempts to escape but any room he attempts to enter contains more skeletons the finale has a terrified mickey crashing through a window to escape the short is clearly similar to the skeleton dance first released on august two two one nine two nine which was the first short of the silly symphonies series both feature elements generally found in horror fiction and particularly in horror films effectively combined with music and dance a series of creative and rather morbid gags provide comedic elements the result is often described as surreal and at points impressive consequently both shorts have been considered among the highlights of their respective series and animated classics earliest adventure at sea another mickey short was released in between them wild waves first released on august one five one nine two nine mickey and minnie are featured spending a day at the beach they are at first singing and dancing at the shore but at some point minnie is swept by a wave into the sea she panicks and seems to start drowning mickey discovers a rowboat placed upside down on the beach he lifts it to discover an amorous couple who were using the boat as their cover from prying eyes mickey proceeds to place it into the water and then rows the boat forward until he reaches minnie he manages to rescue her and return her to the shore but minnie is still visibly shaken from the experience mickey starts singing the tune of rocked in the cradle of the deep in an apparent effort to cheer her up soon seals walruses penguins pelicans and other water birds start dancing to mickey s tune minnie cheers up and the short ends mickey was depicted acting much like a lifeguard during the short otherwise it is only notable as the first of mickey s adventures at sea mouse in transition mickey entering the depression era the twelfth and last mickey short released during the year was jungle rhythm first released on november one five one nine two nine mickey is seen in a safari somewhere in africa he rides on an elephant and is armed with a shotgun but the later proves to be problematic soon after mickey finds himself standing in between of a lion and a bear mickey proceeds to play music to calm them down during the rest of the short various jungle animals dance to mickey s tunes the tunes vary from the previously mentioned yankee doodle and turkey in the straw to auld lang syne the blue danube and aloha oe first comic strip appearance by this point mickey had appeared in fifteen commercially successful animated shorts and was easily recognized by the public so walt disney was approached by king features syndicate with the offer to licence mickey and his supporting characters for use in a comic strip walt accepted and mickey made his first comic strip appearance on january one three one nine three zero the comical plot was credited to walt disney himself art to ub iwerks and inking to win smith the first week or so of the strip featured a loose adaptation of plane crazy minnie soon became the first addition to the cast the strips first released between january one three and march three one one nine three zero have been occasionally reprinted in comic book form under the collective title lost on a desert island classical music performances meanwhile in animation two more mickey shorts had been released the first of them was the barnyard concert first released on march three one nine three zero it featured mickey conducting an orchestra the only recurring characters among its members were clarabelle as a flutist and horace as a drummer their rendition of the poet and peasant is humorous enough but it has been noted that several of the gags featured were repeated from previous shorts the second was originally released on march one four one nine three zero under the title fiddlin around but has since been renamed to just mickey both titles give an accurate enough description of the short which has mickey performing a violin solo it is only notable for mickey s emotional renditions of the finale to the william tell overture robert schumann s tr umerei reverie and franz liszt s hungarian rhapsody no two departure of a co creator and consequences the opening title card of steamboat willie credits both walt disney and ub iwerks they were followed by cactus kid first released on april one one one nine three zero as the title implies the short was intended as a western movie parody but it is considered to be more or less a remake of the gallopin gaucho set in mexico instead of argentina mickey was again cast as a lonely traveler who walks into the local tavern and starts flirting with its dancer the latter is again minnie the rival suitor to mickey is again pete though using the alias peg leg pedro for the first time in a mickey short pete was depicted as having a peg leg this would become a recurring feature of the character the rhea of the original short was replaced by horace horsecollar this is considered to be his last non anthropomorphic appearance the short is considered significant for being the last mickey short to be animated by ub iwerks shortly before its release iwerks had left the studio in an attempt to create his own the result of his early efforts was the flip the frog series his departure is considered to mark a turning point to the careers of both walt disney and mickey mouse the former lost the man who served as his closest colleague and confidant since one nine one nine the latter lost the man responsible for his original design and for the direction and or animation of several of the shorts released till this point and some would argue mickey s creator walt disney has been credited for the inspiration to create mickey but iwerks was the one to design the character and the first few mickey mouse cartoons were mostly or entirely drawn by iwerks consequently some animation historians have suggested that iwerks should be considered the actual creator of mickey mouse it has been pointed that advertising for the early mickey mouse cartoons credit them as a walt disney comic drawn by ub iwerks later disney company reissues of the early cartoons tend to credit walt disney alone in any case walt and his remaining staff continued the production of the mickey series mickey continued to appear regularly in animated shorts until one nine four three and again from one nine four six to one nine five three but back in early one nine three zero walt had another matter to attend to the creation of the comic strip after iwerks departure at first walt was content to continue scripting it and assigning the art to win smith however walt s focus had always been in animation and smith was soon assigned with the scripting as well win smith was apparently discontent at having to script draw and ink a series by himself this became evident by his sudden resignation another reason might be that walt disney was a very impossible man and win smith got sick of this lack of freedom to create in walt proceeded to search for a replacement to smith among the remaining staff of the studio for uncertain reasons he chose floyd gottfredson a recently hired employee at the time floyd was reportedly eager to work in animation and somewhat reluctant to accept his new assignment walt had to assure floyd that the assignment was only temporary and that he would eventually return to animation floyd accepted and ended up holding this temporary assignment from may five one nine three zero to november one five one nine seven five appearances in comics floyd at first had to work on the continuation of a storyline which his predecessors had started on april one one nine three zero the storyline was completed on september two zero one nine three zero and was later reprinted in comic book form as mickey mouse in death valley this early adventure contributed to the extension of the comic strip cast which by this point only included mickey and minnie this story would bring the first comic strip appearances of clarabelle cow horace horsecollar and black pete as well as the debuts of corrupted lawyer sylvester shyster and minnie s uncle mortimer mouse the story was followed by mr slicker and the egg robbers first printed between september two two and december two six one nine three zero which introduced marcus mouse and his wife as minnie s parents starting with these two early comic strip stories mickey s versions in animation and comics are considered to have diverged from each other while disney and his cartoon shorts would continue to focus on comedy the comic strip effectively combined comedy and adventure this adventurous version of mickey would continue to appear in comic strips and later comic books throughout the two zero th and into the two one st century mickey was the main character for the series mm mickey mouse mistery magazine published in italy from one nine nine nine to two zero zero one later mickey history one nine three zero one nine five zero a typical style of sign in walt disney world showing one of many uses by disney of the mickey ears logo in his earliest cartoons mickey was often mischievous and the cartoons sometimes used outhouse humor as the series became more popular disney decided to change his best known character into a well meaning everyman and creating mischief was thereafter left to other characters in one nine three five mickey mouse appeared in color for the first time in the band concert widely considered his best film he is eclipsed somewhat by donald duck who appeared in color before mickey in one nine three four s the wise little hen following two more black and white shorts mickey s service station and mickey s kangaroo also released in one nine three five every other disney cartoon was made in color the band concert somewhat marks the end of mickey as a leading cartoon star the disney studio had a hard time coming up with stories for mickey mickey s service station in one nine three five started a formula that would dominate the mickey cartoons the trio format these cartoons would put mickey donald and goofy together allowing donald and goofy to handle most of the gags the studio realized that while mickey mouse is a very appealing character he is not all that funny once in a while the disney studio would find a perfect vehicle for mickey thru the mirror one nine three six mickey s rival one nine three six the brave little tailor one nine three eight and the nifty nineties one nine four one are all good examples of mickey at his best probably his best film appearance was the popular segment the sorcerer s apprentence in disney s fantasia one nine four zero throughout the four zero s mickey made fewer and fewer films until his last film the simple things in one nine five three mickey would not return to theatres until one nine eight three with the release of mickey s christmas carol from one nine three zero until one nine five zero though the numbers of the comic creators that worked on mickey increased the most popular version considered the classic version today was that of floyd gottfredson who developed mickey s character adopted characters from the cartoons and created many others since one nine five zero the most popular version of mickey has been that of italian creator romano scarpa who has further developed gottfredson s characters and has added many of his own mickey s most well known supporting characters are his girlfriend minnie mouse his dog pluto and his best friends goofy and donald duck by his sister amelia fieldmouse mickey mouse has two nephews the lesser known morty and ferdie fieldmouse in contrast to donald duck s famous nephews huey dewey and louie in one nine two nine disney created the original mickey mouse club for fans of his character and cartoons which later formed the basis for a popular one nine five zero s television show with follow ups of the same name in one nine seven seven and one nine eight nine mickey has only starred in two feature films the sorcerer s apprentence segment in fantasia and the mickey and the beanstalk segment of fun and fancy free one

a star on the hollywood walk of fame the star is located on six nine two five hollywood blvd throughout the decades mickey mouse competed with warner bros bugs bunny for animated popularity but in one nine eight eight in a historic moment in motion picture history the two rivals finally shared screen time in the robert zemeckis film who framed roger rabbit warner and disney signed an agreement stating that each character had exactly the same amount of screen time right down to the semi second only three people have regularly provided the voice for mickey not including theme park attractions and parades walt disney from one nine two eight to one nine four seven james macdonald from one nine four eight to one nine eight three and currently wayne allwine who first voiced the mouse in mickey

the beanstalk section of fun and fancy free mickey s voice was handed over to veteran disney musician and actor jim macdonald both disney s and macdonald s voices can be heard on the final soundtrack macdonald voiced mickey in the remainder of the theatrical shorts and for various television and publicity projects up until his retirement in the mid one nine seven zero s although walt voiced mickey

votes are often made in order to indicate dissatisfaction with the slate of electors presented on a particular ballot or to highlight the inadequacies of a particular voting procedure since most states electoral systems do not provide for blank balloting or a choice of none of the above most protest votes take the form of a clearly non serious candidate s name entered as a write in vote cartoon characters are typically chosen for this purpose as mickey mouse is the most well known and well recognized character in america his name is frequently selected for this purpose other popular selections include donald duck and bugs bunny this phenomenon has the humorous effect of causing mickey mouse to be a minor but perennial contestor of nearly all u s presidential elections a similar phenomenon occurs in the parliament elections in finland and sweden although finns and swedes usually write donald duck or donald duck party as a protest vote as donald is more popular than mickey in these countries pejorative use of mickey s name mickey mouse is a slang expression meaning small time amateurish or trivial musicians often referred to a score that directly follows each action on

five one eight nine four january three one one nine six nine was an indian spiritual master who said to his followers that he was the avatar an incarnation of god although he maintained silence for most of his life his teachings spread worldwide notably through baba s extensive travels and publications his one nine two five quote don t worry be happy which became well known after appearing in a song by bobby mcferrin reflects meher baba s teaching that all human experience reflects god s divine plan and that in the end all will become united with god his samadhi tomb shrine in meherabad outside ahmednagar india has become a place of pilgrimage meher baba s life the events of meher baba s life are well documented typically he lived and travelled in company with the circle of his closest disciples mandali both men and women from whom he demanded absolute obedience it should be noted however that baba was celibate and demanded that his mandali be celibate as well when asked by a rather pert reporter if he had ever fallen in love the characteristic answer was that he loved humanity he and his mandali voluntarily assumed a life of extreme simplicity almost to the point of poverty he spent long periods in intense seclusion fasting and meditation but meher baba would intersperse these periods with wide ranging travels and public gatherings and works of charity including working among the mad and masts who were often destitute early years meher baba was born in pune india his given name was merwan sheriar irani he was the second son of his father sheriar a persian zoroastrian who had been a wandering sufi dervish before settling in pune and sheriar s young wife shireen who called him her most beautiful child his schoolmates nicknamed the charismatic youngster electricity merwan had a sonorous singing voice and was an accomplished multi instrumentalist and poet fluent in half a dozen languages he was especially fond of hafiz persian poetry but also of shakespeare and shelley he was known for his lightning wit and universal knowledge embracing both commerce and the arts he claimed that all major established religions are essentially different beads on the same string quoting freely from all the holy books though merwan had mystical inclinations and experiences he was more interested in sports especially cricket at the age of one nine he met a very old muslim woman a spiritual master named hazrat babajan who kissed him on the forehead on a street in poona shortly after this he also had direct contact with four other perfect masters tajuddin baba of nagpur narayan maharaj of kedgaon sai baba of shirdi and upasni maharaj of sakori meher baba explained that hazrat babajan was a perfect master whose kiss unveiled him spiritually establishing him in a state of consciousness he termed god realization the continuous and permanent experience of infinite knowledge infinite power and infinite bliss according to his mother he went without food or drink for nine months frequently beating his head against a stone to regain normalcy he said that sai baba and upasni maharaj had helped him to integrate this experience with normal consciousness thus enabling baba to function in the world without diminishing his experience of god realization after working for seven years with sadguru upasni maharaj merwan started to attract a following of his own his early followers gave him the name meher baba or compassionate father manzil e meem and meherabad in one nine two two meher baba and his followers established manzil e meem the house of the master in bombay baba demanded strict discipline and obedience from his disciples baba spent this period in meditation and fasting after a year baba and his disciples moved to an area few miles

lepers as he travelled prem ashram in one nine two four meher baba created a resident school at meherabad which he called the prem ashram prem means love the school drew multi denominational students

gestures which were interpreted and spoken out by one of his mandali devoted disciples usually by his disciple eruch jessawalla meher baba said that his silence was not undertaken as a spiritual exercise nor as a vow of silence but undertaken and maintained solely in connection with his universal work i am never silent i speak eternally the voice that is heard deep within the soul is my voice the voice of inspiration of intuition of guidance to those who are receptive to this voice i speak man s inability to live god s words makes the avatar s teaching a mockery instead of practicing the compassion he taught man has waged wars in his name instead of living the humility purity and truth of his words man has given way to hatred greed and violence because man has been deaf to the principles and precepts laid down by god in the past in this present avataric form i observe silence first contacts with the west in the one nine three zero s meher baba began a period of extensive world travel circling the globe many times he made frequent trips to england europe and america it was during this period that he established contact with his first close group of western disciples on his first trip to england in one nine three one he travelled on the ss rajputana the same ship as mahatma gandhi meher baba and gandhi had many private conversations in the west meher baba met with interested individuals who had heard of his spiritual status and his work in india many of whom were notable celebrities and artists such as hollywood stars gary cooper tallulah bankhead mary pickford and douglas fairbanks jr he enjoyed watching chaplin movies comparing creation to movie making in the late three zero s meher baba invited a group of western women to join him in india where he arranged a series of trips that became known as the blue bus tours when they returned home many newspapers treated their journey as an occasion for scandal baba s image on one of his many books the

three meher baba dictated a series of discourses on his alphabet board these discourses transcribed by close disciples address all aspects of the spiritual life and provide practical and simple direction for the aspirant during those years at least one of these discourses appeared in each issue of the monthly meher baba journal c d deshmukh a close disciple of meher baba compiled and edited the dictation and baba personally approved each discourse by signing his name to it before it was published between one nine three nine and one nine five four in india a five volume compilation titled discourses received several printings in one nine six seven two years before passing away meher baba personally supervised the editing and publication of a new three volume version of the discourses

numerous editorial changes not specifically authorized by meher baba work with masts in the one nine four zero s meher baba did extensive work with a category of people he termed masts short for mast allah meaning intoxicated with god these individuals are essentially disabled by their enchanting experience of the higher spiritual planes although outwardly masts appear irrational or even insane meher baba claimed that their spiritual status was actually quite elevated and that by meeting with them he allowed them to move forward spiritually meher baba visited literally thousands of masts throughout the world and occasionally set up ashrams where they were cared for the best known of these masts known as muhammad mast lived at meher baba s encampment at meherabad until his death in two

one three zero seven eight six five four the new life in one nine four nine meher baba began an enigmatic period which he called the new life following a series of questions on their readiness to obey even the most difficult of his requests meher baba selected two zero companions to join him in a life of complete hopelessness helplessness and aimlessness during this time meher baba acted not as the master but as a companion he made provisions for those dependent on him then he and his companions otherwise gave up all property and financial responsibilities they then traveled about india incognito without money begging for their food carrying out baba s instructions and living in strict accordance with a set of conditions of the new life these included absolute acceptance of the circumstances of their life and consistent good cheer in the face of any difficulty those companions who failed to comply were sent away automobile accident in u s a meher baba ended the new life

visited myrtle beach and other places in the us as well as the newly opened avatar s abode in australia automobile accident in india in late one nine five six outside satara india the car in which meher baba was travelling went out of control and a serious accident occurred meher baba suffered a fractured pelvis and other severe injuries dr nilu a close mandali was killed this accident seriously incapacitated meher baba despite his physician s predictions to the contrary after great effort baba managed to walk again but from that point was in constant pain and was severely limited in his ability to move meher baba made one more trip to the west in one nine five eight on this visit he often needed to be carried from venue to venue seclusion and east west gathering meher baba returned to india and began more periods of fasting meditation and seclusion one might have expected such seclusion to be restful on the contrary meher baba s seclusion work was draining and exhausting he claimed to be doing work on behalf of the spiritual welfare of all humanity in one nine six two meher baba gave one of his last public functions a series of meetings he called the east west gathering at these meetings at which his western followers were invited to meet his indian disciples baba gave darshan to many thousands despite the physical strain this caused on his broken body god in a pill in one nine six six at the height of the psychedelic era meher baba allowed individual visits by three young western academics who asked about the spiritual aspects of drugs in response meher baba s words were collected in a pamphlet god in a pill in which he stated that drug use was spiritually damaging saying that if enlightment were possible through drugs then god is not worthy of being god at his request the three returned to the west and spread this message which increased meher baba s notoriety among the young it was during this period that the popular poster of a smiling baba captioned don t worry be happy became widely distributed even appearing in day glo versions final seclusion and amartithi from the east west gathering onward meher baba s health deteriorated steadily despite the physical toll they took on his body meher baba spent long periods in seclusion fasting and meditating his physical condition grew steadily worse in one nine six eight meher baba completed a particularly taxing period of seclusion and emerged saying that his work was completed one zero zero to my satisfaction by this point he was confined to a wheelchair within a few months his condition worsened and he was bed ridden his body wracked by intense muscular spasms that had no clear origin despite the care of several doctors the spasms grew progressively worse on january three one one nine six nine meher baba took his final breaths conveying by his final gesture do not forget that i am god this day became known as amartithi deathless day meher baba s body was laid in his samadhi amongst ice and sawdust and covered with roses it was kept available to the public for one week before its final burial meher baba s portrait on a book by josephine esther ross last darshan before his passing meher baba had made extensive preparations for a public darshan program to be held in pune india his mandali decided to proceed with the arrangements despite the physical absence of the host saying that god had invited them and they were free to keep their appointment several thousands attended this last darshan including many hundred young people from the us england and australia who had been affected by meher baba s anti drug message and by his other teachings cosmology his cosmology which has echoes of sufism and vedanta as well as christian mysticism is summarized in the one nine five four book god speaks much of which meher baba dictated using an english language alphabet board he personally recommended the book to a number of his followers saying it was the most important book for this age evolution and involution meher baba s cosmology is based on divine unity the concept that diverse creation or duality is an illusion i tell you all with my divine authority that you and i are not we but one the oneness of reality is so uncompromisingly unlimited and all pervading that not only we are one but even this collective term of we has no place in the infinite indivisible oneness meher baba says that the goal of life is conscious realization of the absolute oneness of god meher baba s work as avatar is to awaken this oneness in each heart meher baba compares god to an infinite shoreless ocean which has only unconscious divinity unaware of itself because there is nothing but itself to become aware of its divinity the ocean formed drops of itself called drop souls each asking the question who am i in pursuit of the answer to gain conscious divinity each drop soul evolves through experience of each form in the seven kingdoms of evolution these are stone or metal vegetable worm fish bird animal and human the drop soul experiences and discards forms in all these kingdoms accumulating sanskaras or impressions the final form of the soul s evolution is human only human consciousness can achieve awareness of divinity according to meher baba during its evolution however the drop soul also accumulates numerous false sanskaras which prevent the drop soul from automatically realizing its true identity as god ocean once it attains human form to gain its true identity the drop soul traverses an inward spiritual path called involution which gradually eliminates all false sanskaras of separateness from god ocean once the false sanskaras are gone the goal of knowing itself as conscious divinity is attained the drop soul once again becomes merged in the ocean it is has now answered the question of who am i with i am god the first drop soul to answer this question is the avatar he is responsible for each drop soul after him sanskaras as the drop soul progresses through lifetimes it becomes shaped by the impressions or sanskaras picked up by the three forms or bodies it is now associated with the gross body the subtle body and the mental body these three bodies form the individual s consciousness and it is this consciousness which is bound by sanskaras the drop soul is never bound sanskaras are described as binding or unbinding natural or unnatural actions such as murder create unnatural binding sanskaras even good actions can create binding sanskaras eating for example is a natural sanskara but overeating is unnatural sanskaras are individualized and so there is no way of determining the effect of a particular action an action may be good in one instance and bad in another based on the person s intent the law of karma cause and effect balances good and bad actions and their subsequent sanskaras inevitably the individual seeks a life of love for god which is beyond the duality of good and bad this inward journey towards god gradually awakens consciousness until the grace of a perfect master wipes all sanskaras out meher baba stated the wiping out of sanskaras can be effected only by the grace of a perfect master the avatar according to meher baba is the eternal living perfect master the avatar meher baba claimed to be the avatar a sanskrit word meaning descent of god the ancient soul who is literally god in human form meher baba stated that the avatar is the being of beings the same ancient soul taking birth in human form every seven zero zero to one four zero zero years meher baba s followers believe that the avatar incarnated in this cycle of time as zoroaster rama krishna the buddha jesus and muhammad some followers believe that abraham is also the avatar incarnated in a previous cycle of time bhau kalchuri one of baba s closest disciples stated that he believes that noah was the avatar role of the avatar meher baba describes the avatar as a gauge against which man can measure what he is and what he may become he trues the standard of human values by interpreting them in terms of divinely human life in spiritual terms the avatar awakens all souls towards their true identity as god meher baba stated in his own way the avatar unfailingly fulfills his incarnation by giving a spiritual push to his age the avatar helps each individual to break free from his or her bondage in his or her own way in practical terms the avatar lives a human life which provides for future generations a model for compassionate thoughts words and deeds while the avatar is omnipotent and omniscient he completely inhabits his human form and lives for the most part within a human body s constraints in some situations however he may make use of his infinite power knowledge or bliss as jesus christ the avatar made use of powers on the four th plane of consciousness the plane of miracles this power could have also prevented him from horrific torture however he used his powers to have those events occur in order to benefit all of creation for more information on meher baba s concept of the planes of consciousness one may refer to his book god speaks followers of meher baba meher baba traveled around the world several times attracting followers on all continents although he sometimes participated in large public gatherings meher baba discouraged his followers from proselytizing on his behalf rather he stated let your life itself be my message of love and truth to others the silent master p one seven there are no special requirements rites or rituals associated with becoming a follower of meher baba nor are there any specific duties rites or rituals required of his followers many of baba s followers observe a few common practices however gatherings of baba followers when they occur are typically informal and highly social in nature special effort will be made to gather together on amartithi the anniversary of meher baba s death and on his birthday most of meher baba s followers observe silence day on july one zero of each year by keeping verbal silence for two four hours in accordance with the requests baba often made during his life that his followers keep silence or fast on this day three prayers written by meher baba o parvardigar the prayer of repentance and the beloved god prayer are repeated morning and evening at his samadhi and are often repeated at gatherings of his followers at meherabad his followers maintain meher baba s practice of lighting a dhuni fire in a fire ring in meherabad on the one two th of each month after prayers participants throw sandalwood twigs dipped in ghee into the flame as physical representations of desires they wish to relinquish influence on pete townshend meher baba achieved additional fame in the west through the work of pete townshend of the who parts of the rock opera tommy were inspired by townshend s study of meher baba to whom the album was dedicated and whose eye appears on the cover sleeve meher baba s comments on the feelings of hatred greed and violence man entertains are dramatised through the characters of cousin kevin sadism uncle ernie lust and tommy s parents greed the stardom thrust upon tommy as the pinball wizard is an apt metaphor for what meher baba called maya or the life of mere appearances the dramatic highlight of both the album and the movie by ken russell one nine seven five is the smashing of the mirror i e the annihilation of the ego townshend s first commercial solo album who came first was dedicated to

vacuum tube that generates coherent microwaves they are commonly found in the microwave oven as well as various radar applications construction and operation magnetron with section removed magnet is not shown all cavity magnetrons consist of a hot filament cathode kept at or pulsed to a high negative potential by a high voltage direct current power supply the cathode is built into the center of an evacuated lobed circular chamber a perpendicular magnetic field is imposed by a permanent magnet the magnetic field causes the electrons attracted to the relatively positive outer part of the chamber to spiral outward in a circular path rather than moving directly to this anode spaced about the rim of the chamber are cylindrical cavities the cavities are open along their length and so connect the common cavity space as electrons sweep past these openings they induce a resonant high frequency radio field in the cavity which in turn causes the electrons to bunch into groups a portion of this field is extracted with a short antenna that is connected to a waveguide a metal tube usually of rectangular cross section the waveguide directs the extracted rf energy to the load which may be a cooking chamber in a microwave oven or a high gain antenna in the case of radar a cross sectional diagram of a resonant cavity magnetron the size of the cavities determine the resonant frequency and so the frequency of the emitted microwaves the frequency is thus not precisely controllable which is not a problem in many applications such as heating or some forms of radar where the receiver can be synchronised with the nonprecision output where precise frequencies are required other devices such as the klystron are used the voltage applied and the characteristics of the cathode determine the power of the device the magnetron is a fairly efficient device in a microwave oven for instance a one one zero zero watt input will generally create about seven zero zero watts of microwave energy an efficiency around six five this is far more efficient than the klystron which typically operates around three zero modern solid state microwave sources typically operate around two five to three zero and are used primarily because they can generate a wide range of frequencies thus the magnetron remains in widespread use in roles where precise frequency control is not important applications magnetron with magnet in its mounting box the horizontal plates aid in cooling the device by airflow from a fan radar see also history of radar magnetron in radar devices the waveguide is connected to an antenna which may be a slotted waveguide or a conical feedhorn pointing into a parabolic reflector the magnetron is operated with very short high intensity pulses of applied voltage resulting in a short pulse of microwave energy being emitted a small portion of this energy is reflected back to the antenna and the waveguide where it is directed to a sensitive receiver with further signal processing the signal is ultimately displayed as a radar map on a cathode ray tube crt or a liquid crystal display heating in microwave ovens the waveguide leads to a radio frequency transparent port into the cooking chamber it is important that there be food in the oven when it is operated so that these waves are absorbed rather than reflecting back into the waveguide where the intensity of standing waves can cause arcing the arcing if allowed to occur for long periods will destroy the magnetron if a very small object is being microwaved it is recommended to add a glass of water as an energy sink although care must be taken not to superheat the water history influence of a magnetron on a dvd simple two pole magnetrons were developed in the one nine two zero s by albert hull at general electric as an outgrowth of his work on the magnetic control of vacuum tubes in an attempt to work around the patents held by lee deforest on electrostatic control the two pole magnetron also known as a split anode magnetron gave relatively low efficiencies the cavity version properly referred to as a resonant cavity magnetron proved to be far more useful there was an urgent need during radar development in world war ii for a high power microwave generator that worked in shorter wavelengths around one zero cm rather than one five zero cm available from tube based generators of the time it was known that a multi cavity resonant magnetron had been developed in one nine three five by hans hollmann in berlin however the german military considered its frequency drift to be undesirable and based their radar systems on the klystron instead it was primarily for this reason that german night fighter radars were never a match for their british counterparts in one nine four zero at the university of birmingham in the uk john randall and dr harry boot produced a working prototype similar to hollman s cavity magnetron but added liquid cooling and a stronger cavity randall and boot soon managed to increase its power output one zero zero fold instead of giving up on the magnetron due to its frequency innaccuracy they instead sampled the output signal and synced their receiver to whatever frequency was actually being generated an early six kw version built by g e c and given to the u s government in september one nine four zero was called the most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores see tizard mission at the time the most powerful equivalent microwave producer available in the us a klystron had a power of only ten watts the cavity magnetron was widely used during world war ii in microwave radar equipment and is often credited with giving allied radar a considerable performance advantage over german and japanese radars thus directly influencing the outcome of the war short wave centimetric radar which was made possible by the cavity magnetron allowed for the detection of much smaller objects and the use of much smaller antennas the combination of the small sized cavity magnetron small antennas and high resolution allowed small high quality radars to be installed in aircraft they could be used by maritime patrol aircraft to detect objects as small as a submarine periscope which allowed aircraft to attack and destroy submerged submarines which had previously been undetectable from the air centimetric contour mapping radars like h two s improved the accuracy of allied bombers used in the strategic bombing campaign centimetric gun laying radars were likewise far more accurate than the older technology they made the big gunned allied battleships more deadly and along with the newly developed proximity fuze made anti aircraft guns much more dangerous to attacking aircraft the two coupled together and used by anti aircraft batteries placed along on the german v one flying bomb flight paths to london are credited with destroying many of the flying bombs before they reached their target since then many millions of cavity magnetrons have been manufactured some for radar but the vast majority for another application far more domestic the microwave oven the use in radar itself has dwindled to some extent as more accurate signals have generally been needed and developers have moved to klystron and travelling wave tube systems for these needs health hazards caution radiowaves hazard among more speculative hazards at least one in particular is well known and documented as the lens of the eye has no cooling blood flow it is particularly prone to overheating when exposed to microwave radiation this heating can in turn lead to a higher incidence of cataracts in later life a microwave oven with a warped door or poor microwave sealing can be hazardous references t j morgan radar the mechanical age library mullen circa one

open field strip farming some enclosures triennial crop rotation demesne and manse common woodland pasturage and meadow manorialism or seigneurialism describes the organization of rural economy and society in medieval western and parts of central europe characterised by the vesting of legal and economic power in a lord supported economically from his own direct landholding and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under his jurisdiction these obligations could be payable in labour the french term corv e is conventionally applied produce in kind or rarely money the word derives from the inherited traditional divisions of the countryside reassigned as local jurisdictions known as manors or seigneuries each subject to a lord french seigneur usually holding his position in return for undertakings offered to a higher lord see feudalism the lord held a manor court governed by public law and local custom not all territorial seigneurs were secular bishops and abbots held lands that entailed similar obligations in the generic plan of a medieval manor from shepherd s historical atlas illustration right the strips of individually worked land in the open field system are immediately apparent in this plan the manor house is set slightly apart from the village conferring the privacy that has been more a concern since the one eight th century than it was in medieval times equally often the village grew up around the forecourt of the manor formerly walled while the demesne of the manor stretched away outside as still may be seen at petworth house and other english houses with a village front and a park front and most commonly in italy to the contrary when a grand new house was required by the new owner of harlaxton manor lincolnshire in the one eight three zero s the site of the existing manor house at the edge of its village was abandoned for the new jacobethan harlaxton manor isolated in its park with the village out of view the conditions of land tenure underlie all social or economic factors in an agrarian society two legal systems of pre manorial landholding obtained one the most common was the system of holding land allodially in full outright ownership the other was a use of precaria or benefices in which land was held conditionally giving us our word precarious to these two systems the carolingian monarchs added a third the aprisio which linked manorialism with feudalism the aprisio made its first appearance in charlemagne s province of septimania in the south of france when charlemagne had to settle the visigothic refugees who had fled with his retreating forces after the failure of his saragossa expedition of seven seven eight he solved this problem by allotting desert tracts of uncultivated land belonging to the royal fisc under direct control of the emperor these holdings aprisio entailed specific conditions the earliest specific aprisio grant that has been identified was at fontjoncouse near narbonne see lewis links in certain areas of the former empire of the west a system of villas was entrenched in late antiquity and was inherited by the medieval world common features manors each consisted of up to three classes of land demesne the part controlled immediately by the lord and exploited directly for the benefit of his household and dependents dependent serf or villein holdings carrying the obligation that the peasant household supply the lord with specified labour services or a part of its output or cash in lieu thereof subject to the custom attached to the holding and free peasant land without such obligation but otherwise subject to manorial jurisdiction and custom and owing money rent fixed at the time of the lease additional sources of income from the lord included charges for use of his mill bakery or wine press or for the right to hunt or to let pigs feed in his woodland as well as court revenues and single payments on each change of tenant on the other side of the account manorial administration involved significant expenses perhaps a reason why smaller manors tended to rely less on villein tenure villein holdings were held nominally by arrangement of lord and tenant but tenure became in practice almost universally hereditary with a payment being made to the lord on the succession of another member of the family villein land could not be abandoned at least until demographic and economic circumstances made flight a viable proposition nor could they be passed to a third party without the lord s permission and the customary payment though not free villeins were by no means in the same position as slaves they enjoyed legal rights subject to local custom and had recourse to the law subject to court charges which were an additional source of manorial income sub letting of villein holdings was not uncommon and labour on the demesne might be commuted into an additional money payment as happened increasingly from the one three th century this description of a manor house at chingford essex in england was recorded in a document for the chapter of st paul s cathedral when it was granted to robert le moyne in one two six five he received also a sufficient and handsome hall well ceiled with oak on the western side is a worthy bed on the ground a stone chimney a wardrobe and a

translations and reprints one eight nine seven in middle ages volume i pp two eight three two eight four variation among manors like feudalism which together with manorialism forms the legal and organisational framework of what is often termed feudal society manorial structures must not be imagined as a uniform phenomenon universal among societies exhibiting such characteristics areas of incomplete or non existent manorialisation persisted into the later middle ages while manorial economy underwent substantial development with changing economic conditions not all manors contained all three kinds of land as an average demesne accounted for roughly a third of the arable area and villein holdings rather more but some manors consisted solely of demesne others solely of peasant holdings the proportion of unfree and free tenures could likewise vary greatly necessitating greater or lesser reliance on wage labour for the performance of agricultural work on the demesne the proportion of the cultivated area in demesne tended to be greater in smaller manors while the share of villein land was greater in large manors providing the lord of the latter with a larger potential supply of obligatory labour for demesne work the proportion of free tenements was in general less variable but tended to be somewhat greater on the smaller manors manors varied similarly in their geographical arrangement most did not coincide with a single village but rather consisted of parts of two or more villages most of the latter containing also parts of at least one other manor this situation sometimes led to the replacement by cash payments of the demesne labour obligations of those peasants living furthest from the lord s estate as was the case with peasant plots the demesne was not a single territorial unit but consisted rather of a central house with neighbouring land and estate buildings plus strips dispersed through the manor alongside free and villein ones in addition the lord might lease free tenements belonging to neighbouring manors as well as holding other manors some distance away to provide a greater range of produce nor were manors held necessarily by lay lords rendering military service or again cash in lieu to their superior a substantial share estimated by value at one seven in england in one zero eight six belonged directly to the king and a greater proportion rather more than a quarter were held by bishoprics and monasteries ecclesiastical manors tended to be larger with a significantly greater villein area than neighbouring lay manors the effect of circumstances on manorial economy is complex and at times contradictory upland conditions have been seen as tending to preserve peasant freedoms livestock husbandry in particular being less labour intensive and therefore less demanding of villein services on the other hand some such areas of europe have been said to show some of the most oppressive manorial conditions while lowland eastern england is credited with an exceptionally large free peasantry in part a legacy of scandinavian settlement similarly the spread of money economy is often seen as having stimulated the replacement of labour services by money payments but the growth of the money supply and resulting inflation after one one seven zero initially led nobles to take back leased estates and to re impose labour dues as the value of fixed cash payments declined in real terms historical development and geographical distribution the term is most often used with reference to medieval western europe antecedents of the system can be traced to the rural economy of the later roman empire with a declining birthrate and population the key factor of production was labour successive administrations tried to stabilise the imperial economy by freezing the social structure into place sons were to succeed their fathers in their trade councillors were forbidden to resign and coloni the cultivators of land were not to move from the demesne they were attached to they were on their way to becoming serfs several factors conspired to merge the status of former slaves and former free farmers into a dependent class of such coloni laws of constantine the great around three two five presuppose not only the negative semi servile status of the coloni but also their rights to sue in the courts their numbers were augmented by barbarian foederati who were permitted to settle within the imperial boundaries as the germanic kingdoms succeeded roman authority in the west in the fifth century the roman landlord was often simply replaced by the barbarian with little change to the underlying situation the process of rural self sufficiency was given an abrupt boost in the eighth century when normal trade in the mediterranean sea was disrupted the thesis put forward by henri pirenne disputed by many supposes that the arab conquests forced the medieval economy into even greater ruralisation and gave rise to the classic feudal pattern of varying degrees of servile peasantry underpinning a hierarchy of localised power centres see also seigneurial system of new france in one seven th century

grossing film in the history of hollywood and received a record breaking number of academy awards early life mitchell was born in atlanta georgia and often used the name peggy her childhood it seems was spent in the laps of civil war veterans and of her maternal relatives who lived through the war and the years that followed they told her everything about the war except that the confederates had lost it she was ten years old before making this discovery after graduating from washington seminary now the westminster schools she attended smith college but withdrew following her final exams in one nine one eight she returned to atlanta to take over the household after her mother s death earlier that year from the great influenza pandemic of one nine one eight and mitchell used this pivotal scene from her own life to dramatize scarlett s discovery of her mother s death from typhoid when scarlett returns to tara shortly afterward she joined the staff of the atlanta journal where she wrote a weekly column for the newspaper s sunday edition mitchell married red upshaw in one nine two two but they were divorced after it was revealed that he was a bootlegger she married upshaw s friend john marsh on july four one nine two five marsh had been best man at her first wedding and legend has it that both men courted mitchell in one nine two one and one nine two two but upshaw proposed first gone with the wind mitchell is reported to have begun writing gone with the wind while bedridden and nursing a broken ankle her husband john marsh brought home historical books from the public library to amuse her while she convalesced finally after she supposedly read all the historical books in the library he told her peggy if you want another book why don t you write your own she drew upon her encyclopedic knowledge of the civil war and used dramatic moments from her own life to write her epic novel typing it out on an old remington typewriter she originally called her heroine pansy o hara and tara was fontenoy hall when naming her great american novel she considered naming it tote your heavy load or tomorrow is another day mitchell wrote for her own amusement with solid support from her husband but she kept her literary efforts a secret from all her friends she would hide the voluminous pages under towels disguising them as a divan or hide pages in her closets or under her bed she wrote in a haphazard fashion writing the last chapter first and skipping around from chapter to chapter her husband regularly proofread her mounting manuscript to help in continuity by one nine two nine when her ankle had healed and most of the book was written she lost interest in pursuing her literary efforts while margaret mitchell used to say that her gone with the wind characters were not based on real people modern researchers have found similarities to some of the people in mitchell s own life as well as to individuals she knew or she heard of rhett butler is thought to be based on mitchell s first husband red upshaw another at least partial character source for scarlett o hara might have been martha bulloch roosevelt the mother of us president theodore roosevelt mitchell lived her life as a modest atlanta housewife until a fateful visit from a macmillan publisher howard latham who came to atlanta in one nine three five latham was scouring the south for promising new southern writers and mitchell agreed to escort him around atlanta at the request of her friend who now worked for latham latham was enchanted with mitchell and asked her if she had ever written a book mitchell demurred she was too professional to even dream of showing her old haphazard manuscript to a publisher well if you ever do write a book please show it to me first latham implored later that day a friend of mitchell s having heard this conversation laughed imagine anyone as silly as peggy writing a book she said mitchell stewed over this comment went home and found most of the old crumbling envelopes containing her disjointed manuscript which she had stowed away she arrived at the georgian terrace hotel just as latham was preparing to depart atlanta here she said take this before i change my mind latham bought an extra suitcase to accommodate the giant manuscript that had piled taller than the diminutive author when mitchell arrived home she was horrified over her impetuous act she sent a telegram to latham have changed my mind send manuscript back it was too late latham had read enough pages of the disjointed disintegrating manuscript to realize he had a blockbuster instead of returning the manuscript he wrote to her of his thoughts on the potential success of the manuscript s eventual publication macmillan soon sent her an advance check to encourage her to complete the novel oddly enough mitchell had never composed a first chapter for the manuscript mitchell completed her work in march one nine three six gone with the wind was published

nine deaths road accident victims atlantans american writers american novelists pulitzer prize winners miscibility is the ability of two or more substances to mix and form a single homogeneous phase when two substances are immiscible they will form separate phases when mixed the best known example is oil and water on the other hand water and ethanol are miscible in all proportions and some combinations of substances are only somewhat miscible for example adding more than a certain amount of table salt to water will leave some in the solid phase though this is more properly a solution one specific type of mixture miscibility is partly a function of entropy and so is seen more commonly in states of matter that are more entropic gasses mix quite readily but solids only rarely display complete miscibility two useful exceptions to this rule are solid solutions of copper with nickel the cupronickel used in coins and specialty plumbing and of silicon with germanium used in electronics substances with extremely low configurational entropy especially polymers are unlikely to be miscible in one another even in the liquid state chemical properties notoc metamorphosis is a process in biology by which an individual physically develops after birth or hatching and involves significant change in form as well as growth and differentiation it usually accompanies a change of habitat or of habits but may occur without such change it was once thought that in those cases where the animal s habitat remains unchanged metamorphosis followed a series of forms representing evolutionary ancestors of the species in question see ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny but this is no longer thought to be true the first type of metamorphosis is illustrated by many insects and by amphibians immature dragonflies are aquatic though the adults are flying insects and frogs undergo a metamorphosis from an aquatic tadpole to an amphibious adult form change of habits is illustrated by the transformation of the free swimming young of many aquatic invertebrates into sessile adults eg sea squirts and the development of butterflies and moths from caterpillars with chewing mouthparts into flying insects with sucking mouthparts the second type is illustrated by many crustacean species whose young undergo significant physical metamorphosis without changing habits or habitat significantly the immature stages of a species that undergoes metamorphosis are designated by the term larva in the complex metamorphosis of many insect species however only the first stage is called a larva and sometimes even that bears a different name the distinction depends upon the nature of the metamorphosis some insects hatch from the egg already having the general form of the adult and the metamorphosis to adult form is usually marked mainly by the development of wings this type of metamorphosis is called simple gradual or incomplete metamorphosis hemimetabolism and the young are called nymphs or naiads when aquatic it is often found in the order mantodea or genus stagomantis which is commonly known as the praying mantis they do not undergo stages like a caterpillar to a butterfly instead they undergo several stages where the nymph of e g a praying mantis looks like a smaller sized wingless adult and ends the metamorphosis with fully developed wings insects with complete metamorphosis pass through a larval stage and then enter an inactive state known as a pupa or chrysalis finally emerging as the adult form a number of beetle species and strepsiptera undergo hypermetamorphosis with a sequence of different larval forms preceding pupation whether the insect spends more time in its adult stage or in its juvenile form depends on the individual species notable examples of the latter are the mayfly whose non eating adult stage lives as little as a single day and the cicada whose juvenile stage lives underground for as much as seventeen years however these species have incomplete metamorphosis typically though not exclusively species in which the adult form outlives the juvenile form undergo complex metamorphosis many observations have indicated that cell death plays a considerable role during physiological processes of multicellular organisms particularly during embryogenesis and metamorphosis species egg larva nymph pupa adult housefly one day

while all endopterygota are holometabolic it must be noted however that a few exopterygota e g thysanoptera aleyrodidae and male coccoidea are subject to a metamorphosis more similar to the hemimetabolic one hormonal control of metamorphosis in insects insect growth and metamorphosis are controlled by hormones syntesized by endocrine glands near the front of the body some cells of insect brain secrete a hormone that activates thoracic glands once they are activated these glands secrete a second hormone usually ecdysone a steroid that induces metamorphosis moreover the corpora allata produce the juvenile hormone whose effect is to prevent the development of adult characteristics while allowing moults therefore the insect is subject to a series of moult controlled by ecdysone until the production of juvenile hormone ceases and metamorphosis occurs see also holometabolism hemimetabolism ametabolism hypermetamorphosis developmental biology external links info on butterflies and

drugs prescribed for the treatment of depression due to potentially serious dietary and drug interactions they are used less frequently than other classes of antidepressant drugs for example tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors however in some cases where patients are unresponsive to other treatments they are tried often with a marked success they are particularly effective in treating atypical depression and have shown efficacy in helping smokers to quit uses therapeutical use in the past they were prescribed for those resistant to tricyclic antidepressant therapy but newer maois are now sometimes used as first line therapy they are also used for treating agoraphobia and social anxiety maois in their original form presented an unusual problem for the prescribing physician if a physician was prescribing maois for depression he she had to take into consideration the fact that he she was offering the patient a ready though unpleasant route to suicide currently the availability of selegiline and moclobemide provides a safer alternative although not always as effective as the old types traditional and entheogenic use maois can be used to potentiate the effect of a number of hallucinogenic drugs notably phenethylamines tryptamines dxm and several others ayahuasca an entheogenic brew traditionally used in strict ritual context by south american indians is a mixture of banisteriopsis caapi a vine containing various harmala alkaloids and another plant containing n n dmt or five meo dmt alkaloids usually psychotria viridis or diplopterys cabrerana modern western analogues to ayahuasca often substitute syrian rue for b caapi and mimosa hostilis as a dmt source as dmt is inactive orally on its own it must be combined with maoi when taken orally mode of action maois act by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase preventing the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters and so increasing the available stores there are two isoforms mao a and mao b mao a preferentially deaminates serotonin melatonin adrenaline and noradrenaline mao b preferentially deaminates phenylethylamine and trace amines dopamine is equally deaminated by both types reversibility the early maois inhibited monoamine oxidase irreversibly when they react with monoamine oxidase they permanently deactivate it and the enzyme cannot function until it has been replaced by the body which can take about two weeks a few newer maois notably moclobemide are reversible meaning that they can inhibit the enzyme for a time but eventually detach allowing the enzyme to function once more selectivity in addition to reversibility maois differ by their selectivity of the mao receptor older maois inhibit both mao a and mao b equally but newer maois have been developed that target one over the other for example a three zero zero mg dose of moclobemide manerix aurorix causes eight zero inhibition of mao a and two zero three zero inhibition of mao b dangers when ingested orally maois inhibit the catabolism of dietary amines sufficient intestinal mao a inhibition can lead to hypertensive crises when foods containing tyramine are consumed or hyperserotonemia if foods containing tryptophan are consumed hypertensive crises can sometimes result in stroke or cardiac arrythmia if not treated this risk is not present with rimas both kinds of intestinal mao inhbition can cause hyperpyrexia if levodopa containing foods are consumed examples of foods with high levels of tyramine include liver chianti and other aged wines aged cheeses meat extracts e g bovril and yeast extracts e g marmite vegemite a separate list of foods containing tyramine has been established examples of levodopa containing foods include broad beans although the maoi diet is not necessary for those taking selective mao a inhibitors the same drugs should still be avoided since the selective maois are not one zero zero selective taking a drug metabolized by mao b will still be dangerous while taking a selective mao a inhibitor combined use of non selective mao inhibitors or mao a inhibitors and serotonergic drugs such as mdma is likely to lead to serotonin syndrome list of maois monoamine oxidase inhibitors include isocarboxazid marplan moclobemide aurorix manerix moclodura phenelzine nardil tranylcypromine parnate selegiline selegiline eldepryl harmala

as a distinct disease as early as the fifth and fourth centuries bc in the hippocratic writings it was characterized by aversion to food despondency sleeplessness irritability restlessness as well as the statement that grief and fear when lingering provoke melancholia it is now generally believed that melancholia was the same phenomenon as what is now called clinical depression melancholia i by albrecht d rer the name melancholia comes from the old medical theory of the four humours disease being caused by an imbalance in one or other of the four basic bodily fluids or humours personality types were similarly determined by the dominant humour in a particular person melancholia was caused by an excess of black bile hence the name which means black bile greek melas black khol bile a person whose constitution tended to have a preponderance of black bile had a melancholic disposition see also sanguine phlegmatic choleric during the early one seven th century a curious cultural and literary cult of melancholia arose in england it was believed that the passing of the dazzling culture of elizabethan england after the death of queen elizabeth i together with religious uncertainties caused by the english reformation and a greater attention being paid to issues of sin damnation and salvation led to this cultural mood in music the post elizabethan cult of melancholia is associated with john dowland whose motto was semper dowland semper dolens always dowland always mourning the melancholy man known to contemporaries as a malcontent is epitomized by shakespeare s prince hamlet the melancholy dane another literary expression of this cultural mood comes from the death obsessed later works of john donne other major melancholic authors include sir thomas browne and jeremy taylor whose hydriotaphia urn burial and holy living and holy dying respectively contain extensive meditations on death but the most extended treatment of the cult of melancholia comes from robert burton whose anatomy of melancholy treats the subject from both a literary and a medical perspective a famous allegorical engraving by albrecht d rer is entitled melancholia i amongst other allegorical symbols it includes a magic square and a truncated cube the image in turn inspired a sonnet by edward dowden a similar phenomenon though not under the same name occurred during romanticism

leaves the best known species is mimosa pudica which is also known as the sensitive plant or sleeping grass because of the way it folds its leaves down when touched many others also fold their leaves in the evening it is native to southern mexico and central america but is widely cultivated elsewhere for its curiosity value both as an indoor plant in temperate areas and outdoors in the tropics outdoor cultivation has led to weedy invasivion in some areas notably hawaii members of this genus are among the few plants capable of rapid movement examples outside of mimosa include the telegraph plant and the venus flytrap the genus mimosa has had a tortuous history having gone through periods of splitting and lumping ultimately accumulating over three zero zero zero names many of which have either been synonymized under other species or transferred to other genera in part due to these changing circumscriptions the name mimosa has also been applied to several other related species with similar pinnate or bipinnate leaves but now classified in other genera most commonly to albizia julibrissin silk tree and acacia dealbata silver wattle in russia it is customary to present women with

of angostura bitters stirred with ice and strained into a martini cocktail glass garnished with a maraschino cherry with a stem a manhattan is also frequently served on the rocks in an old fashioned glass these days bitters are omitted by many barmen unless specifically requested however purists will maintain the bitters are required to offset the sweetness of the whiskey and vermouth still some tipplers add juice from the cherry jar or maraschino liqueur to the cocktail for sweetness and color some recipes call for substituting orange bitters for the angostura bitters the manhattan has never quite measured up to its cousin the martini whose delicate balance of flavors arguably create a more sophisticated drink as well as a more intoxicating drink due to larger proportions of distilled

and was the first non supernova variable star discovered with the possible exception of algol apart from the odd eta carinae mira is the brightest periodic variable in the sky that is not visible during part of its cycle its distance is uncertain pre hipparcos estimates centered around two two zero light years one while hipparcos data suggests a distance of four one seven light years albeit with a margin of error of one four the companion star was resolved by the hubble space telescope in one nine nine five when it was seven zero astronomical units from the primary results were announced in one nine nine seven the hst ultraviolet images and later x ray images by the chandra space telescope show a spiral of gas rising off mira in the direction of mira b the companion s orbital period around mira is approximately four zero zero years mira became the type star of the long period mira variables it and the other six zero zero zero or so known stars of this class are all red giants whose surfaces oscillate in such a way as to increase and decrease in brightness over periods ranging from about eight zero days to more than one zero zero zero in the particular case of mira its increases in brightness take it up to about magnitude three five on average which is a fairly noticeable star individual cycles vary too well attested maxima go as high as magnitude two zero in brightness and as low as four nine a range almost one five times in brightness and there are historical suggestions that the real spread may be three times this or more minima range much less and have historically been between eight six and one zero one a factor of four times in luminosity the total swing in brightness from absolute maximum to absolute minimum two events which did not occur on the same cycle is one seven zero zero times interestingly since mira emits the vast majority of its radiation in the infrared its variability in that band is only about two magnitudes two the shape of its light curve is of an increase over about one zero zero days and a return twice as long a recent lightcurve is available from the bav discovery mira was discovered or at least noted as special for the first time after a series of observations by the astronomer david fabricius beginning on august three one five nine six observing the planet mercury he needed a reference star for comparing positions and picked a previously unremarked third magnitude star nearby by august two one however it had increased in brightness by one magnitude then by october had faded from view fabricius assumed it was a nova interesting enough but then saw it again on february one six one six zero nine eventually johann holwarda determined a period of the star s reappearances eleven months johannes hevelius was observing it at the same time and named it mira meaning wonderful in one six six two s historiola mirae stellae for it acted like no other known star in the sky ismail bouillaud then nailed the period down to three three three days less than one day off of the modern value of three three two days and perfectly forgivable as mira is known to vary slightly in period and may even be slowly changing over time there is considerable speculation as to whether or not mira had been observed prior to fabricius certainly algol s history known for certain as a variable only in one six six seven but with legends and such stretching back to antiquity showing that it had been observed with suspicion for millennia suggested that mira might have been known too karl manitius a translator of hipparchus commentary on aratus has suggested that certain lines from that second century bc text may be about mira the other usual pre telescopic western suspects the catalogs of ptolemy al sufi ulugh beg and tycho brahe turn up no mentions even as a regular star there are three observations from chinese and korean archives in one five nine six one zero seven zero and the same year when hipparchus would

high in vitamin b one two have been contradicted in some studies part of the confusion may stem from the fact that some soy products are high in b vitamins though not necessarily b one two and some such as soy milk may be fortified with vitamin b one two some especially proponents of healthy eating suggest that miso can help treat radiation sickness citing cases in japan and russia where people have been fed miso after the chernobyl nuclear disaster and the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki notably japanese doctor shinichiro akizuki director of saint francis hospital in nagasaki

beans out of a barrel the person thought if it could sustain a horse it could certainly do the same for a human the people survived the siege and miso was born a researcher from the edo period claimed that miso originally came from ancient china at the time miso was also called hishio and kuki until the muromachi era miso was made without grinding the soybeans somewhat like natto in the kamakura era a common meal was made up of a bowl of rice dried fish a serving of miso and a fresh vegetable in the muromachi era buddhist monks realized that soybeans could be ground into a paste spawning new cooking methods where miso was used to flavour other foods miso uses in japan miso is used in miso shiru miso soup which is eaten daily by much of the population most cooks recommend never cooking miso for more than a few minutes and not above a simmer to avoid decreasing the nutritional value of miso some people especially outside of japan go so far as to only add miso to preparations after

by ceding cumbria then consisting of cumberland and part of westmorland to him in the year nine four five on condition that he would defend that northern county and become an ally of edmund i this therefore required scotland to send military support if england was attacked by either the danes of northumbria or the norwegians of ireland the alliance between england and scotland remained after the death of both kings edred of england the brother and successor of edmund i accordingly applied for and obtained the aid of malcolm i against anlaf king of northumberland whose country according to

medieval gaels historical figures portrayed by shakespeare in computer networking the term maximum transmission unit mtu refers to the size in bytes of the largest datagram that a given layer of a communications protocol can pass onwards mtu parameters usually appear in association with a communications interface nic serial port etc theory the internet protocol allows ip fragmentation allowing a datagram to sub divide into pieces each small enough to pass over a link with a smaller mtu than the original datagram size this fragmentation takes place at the ip layer osi layer three and uses the mtu parameter of the network interface that will send the packet out onto the link the fragmentation process marks the fragments of the original packet so that the ip layer of the destination host can reassemble the packets into the original datagram the internet protocol defines the path mtu of an internet transmission path as the smallest mtu of any of the ip hops of the path from the source address to the destination address or looked at another way the path mtu defines the largest mtu value that can traverse the path without the packets sufferring further fragmentation rfc one one nine one describes path mtu discovery a technique for determining the path mtu between two ip hosts with a view to avoiding ip fragmentation this technique makes use of feedback to the source address of the results of sending gradually increasing datagram sizes with the df don t fragment bit set any device along the path that needs to fragment the packet will drop the packet instead and send an icmp datagram too big response back to the source address through this probing the source host learns the largest mtu that can pass that path without fragmenting potential problems and troubleshooting unfortunately increasing numbers of networks block all icmp traffic e g to prevent denial of service attacks this prevents path mtu discovery from working one often detects such blocking in the cases where a connection works for low volume data but hangs as soon as a host sends a large block of data at a time for example with irc a client might see up to the nospoof ping but get no response after that as the large set of welcome messages freezes up the connection also in an internet protocol network the path from the source address to the destination address often gets modified dynamically in response to various events load balancing congestion outages etc this could result in the path mtu changing sometimes repeatedly during a transmission which may introduce further packet drops before the host finds the new safe mtu most modern ethernet lans use an mtu of one five zero zero bytes but systems like pppoe will reduce this causing path mtu discovery to come into effect with the possible effect of making some sites behind badly configured firewalls unreachable one can possibly work around this depending on which part of the network one controls for example one can change the mss maximum segment size in the initial packet that sets up the tcp connection at one s firewall to do so in a linux router iptables i forward p tcp m tcp tcp flags syn rst syn j tcpmss clamp mss to pmtu some ibm systems the xseries for example which support the older ethernet protocols might require setting the mtu value to one four nine two in order to operate on a typical modern lan one can

five five cm see the noaa site for more detail geology isolated ridges of lava and hydrothermally altered rock especially in the area of sherman crater are exposed between glaciers on the upper flanks of the volcano the lower flanks are steep and heavily vegetated the volcano rests on a foundation of non volcanic rocks in a region that is largely non volcanic in origin the present day cone is relatively young perhaps less than three zero zero zero zero years old but it sits atop a similar older volcanic cone called black buttes volcano which was active between five zero zero zero zero zero and three zero zero zero zero zero years ago much of mount baker s earlier geological record was eroded away during the last ice age which culminated one five zero zero zero two zero zero zero zero years ago by thick ice sheets that filled the valleys and covered much of the region in the last one four zero zero zero years the area around the mountain has been largely ice free but the mountain itself remains heavily mantled with snow and ice deposits which record the last one four zero zero zero years at mount baker indicate that mount baker has not had highly explosive eruptions like those of mount st helens or glacier peak nor has it erupted frequently during this period only four episodes of magmatic eruptive activity can be definitively recognized magmatic eruptions have produced tephra pyroclastic flows and lava flows from summit vents and from the schriebers meadow cinder cone however the most destructive and most frequent events at mount baker have been debris flows and debris avalanches many if not most of which were not related to magmatic activity but may have been induced by steam emissions earthquakes heavy rainfall or in some other way park and rainbow glaciers on the northeast flank historical activity at mount baker includes several explosions during the mid one nine th century which were witnessed from the bellingham area and since the late one nine five zero s numerous small volume debris avalanches in one nine seven five increased fumarolic activity in the sherman crater area caused concern that an eruption might be imminent additional monitoring equipment was installed and several geophysical surveys were conducted to try to detect the movement of magma the level of baker lake was lowered and people were restricted from the area due to concerns that an eruption induced debris avalanche or debris flow might enter baker lake and displace enough water to either cause a wave to overtop the upper baker dam or cause complete failure of the dam however few anomalies other than the increased heat flow were recorded during the geophysical surveys nor were any other precursory activities observed to indicate that magma was moving up into the volcano an increased level of fumarolic activity has continued at mount baker from one nine seven five to the present but there are no other changes that suggest that magma movement is

births living people malware a portmanteau of malicious software is software designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system without the owner s consent the term describes the intent of the creator rather than any particular features malware is commonly taken to include computer viruses trojan horses spyware and adware in law malware is sometimes known as a computer contaminant for instance in the legal codes of california virginia and several other u s states malware is sometimes pejoratively called scumware malware should not be confused with defective software that is software which has a legitimate purpose but contains errors or bugs goals over the years people have written malicious software for a number of different purposes many early infectious programs including the internet worm and a number of ms dos viruses were written as experiments or pranks generally intended to be harmless or merely annoying rather than to cause serious damage young programmers learning about the possibility of viruses and the techniques used to write them might write one just to prove that they can do it or to see how far it could spread a slightly more hostile intent can be found in programs designed to vandalize or cause data loss many dos viruses were designed to destroy files on a hard disk or to corrupt the filesystem by writing junk data network borne worms such as the code red worm or ramen worm fall into the same category designed to vandalize web pages these worms may seem like an online equivalent of graffiti tagging with the author s name or affinity group appearing everywhere the worm goes revenge is sometimes a motive to write malicious software a programmer or system administrator about to be fired from a job may leave behind backdoors or software time bombs that will allow them to damage the former employer s systems or destroy their own earlier work however since the rise of widespread broadband internet access a greater portion of malicious software has been focused strictly on a profit motive for instance since two zero zero three the majority of widespread viruses and worms have been designed to take control of users computers for black market exploitation infected zombie computers are used to send email spam to host contraband data such as child pornography or to engage in distributed denial of service attacks as a form of extortion another strictly for profit category of malware has emerged in spyware programs designed to monitor users web browsing display unsolicited advertisements and redirect affiliate marketing revenues to the spyware creator spyware programs don t spread like viruses usually they are installed by exploiting browser security holes or are installed like a trojan horse when the user installs other software infectious malware viruses and worms the best known types of malware viruses and worms are known for the manner in which they spread rather than any other particular behavior originally the term computer virus was used for a program which infected other executable software while a worm transmitted itself over a network to infect computers more recently the words are often used interchangeably today some draw the distinction between viruses and worms by saying that a virus requires user intervention to spread whereas a worm spreads automatically this means that infections transmitted by email which rely on the recipient opening an attachment to infect the system are classed as viruses capsule history of viruses and worms main articles computer virus computer worm before internet access became widespread viruses spread on personal computers by infecting programs or the executable boot sectors of floppy disks by inserting a copy of itself into the machine code instructions in these executables a virus causes itself to be run whenever the program is run or the disk is booted early computer viruses were written for the apple ii and macintosh but they became more widespread with the dominance of the ibm pc and ms dos system executable infecting viruses are dependent on users exchanging software or boot floppies so they spread heavily in computer hobbyist circles the first worms network borne infectious programs originated not on personal computers but on multitasking unix systems the first well known worm was the internet worm of one nine eight eight which infected sunos and vax bsd systems unlike a virus this worm did not insert itself into other programs rather it exploited security holes in network server programs and started itself running as a separate process this same behavior is used by today s worms as well with the rise of the microsoft windows platform in the one nine nine zero s and the flexible macro systems of its applications it became possible to write infectious code in the macro language of microsoft word and similar programs these macro viruses infect documents and templates rather than applications but rely on the fact that macros in a word document are a form of executable code today worms are most commonly written for the windows os although a small number are also written for linux and other unix systems worms today work in the same basic way as one nine eight eight s internet worm they scan the network for computers with vulnerable network services break in to those computers and copy themselves over worm outbreaks have become a cyclical plague for both home users and businesses eclipsed recently in terms of damage by spyware concealment trojan horses and rootkits for a malicious program to accomplish its goals it must be able to do so without being shut down by the user or administrator of the computer it s on concealment can also help get the malware installed in the first place by disguising a malicious program as something innocuous or desirable users may be tempted to install it without knowing what it does this is the technique of the trojan horse or trojan broadly speaking a trojan horse is any program that invites the user to run it but conceals a harmful or malicious payload the payload may take effect immediately and can lead to many undesirable effects such as deleting all the user s files or more commonly it may install further harmful software into the user s system to serve the creator s longer term goals trojan horses known as droppers are used to start off a worm outbreak by injecting the worm into users local networks one of the most common ways that spyware is distributed is as a trojan horse bundled with a piece of desirable software that the user downloads off the web or a peer to peer file trading network when the user installs the software the spyware is installed alongside spyware authors who attempt to act legally may include an end user license agreement which states the behavior of the spyware in loose terms but with the knowledge that users are unlikely to read or understand it once a malicious program is installed on a system it is often useful to the creator if it stays concealed the same is true when a human attacker breaks into a computer directly techniques known as rootkits allow this concealment by modifying the host operating system so that the malware is hidden from the user rootkits can prevent a malicious process from being reported in the process table or keep its files from being read originally a rootkit was a set of tools installed by a human attacker on a unix system where the attacker had gained administrator root access today the term is used more generally for concealment routines in a malicious program malware for profit spyware botnets loggers and dialers during the one nine eight zero s and one nine nine zero s it was usually taken for granted that malicious programs were created as a form of vandalism or prank more recently the greater share of malware programs have been written with a financial or profit motive in mind this can be taken as the malware authors choice to monetize their control over infected systems to turn that control into a source of revenue since two zero zero three or so the most costly form of malware in terms of time and money spent in recovery has been the broad category known as spyware spyware programs are commercially produced for the purpose of gathering information about computer users showing them pop up ads and altering web browser behavior to financially benefit the spyware creator for instance some spyware programs redirect search engine results to pages full of paid advertisements others deemed stealware by the media overwrite affiliate marketing codes so that the revenue goes to the spyware creator rather than a legitimate web site owner spyware programs are usually installed as trojan horses of one sort or another they differ in that their creators present themselves openly as businesses for instance by selling advertising space on the pop ups created by the malware most such programs present the user with an end user license agreement which purportedly protects the creator from prosecution under computer contaminant laws however spyware eulas have not yet been upheld in court another way that financially motivated malware creator can monetize their infections is to directly use the infected computers to do work for the creator spammer viruses such as the sobig and mydoom virus families are commissioned by e mail spam gangs the infected computers are used as proxies to send out spam messages the advantage to spammers of using infected computers is that they are available in large supply thanks to the virus and they provide anonymity protecting the spammer from prosecution spammers have also used infected pcs to target anti spam organizations with distributed denial of service attacks in order to coordinate the activity of many infected computers attackers have used coordinating systems known as botnets in a botnet the malware logs in to an internet relay chat channel or other chat system the attacker can then give instructions to all the infected systems simultaneously botnets can also be used to push upgraded malware to the infected systems keeping them resistant to anti virus software or other security measures lastly it is possible for a malware creator to profit by simply stealing from the person whose computer is infected stealing here can mean stealing information such as passwords or outright financial theft some malware programs install a key logger which copies down the user s keystrokes when entering a password credit card number or other useful information this is then transmitted to the malware creator automatically enabling credit card fraud and other theft similarly malware may copy the cd key or password for online games allowing the creator to steal accounts or virtual items another way of stealing money from the infected pc owner is to take control of the modem and dial an expensive toll call dialer or porn dialer software dials up a premium rate telephone number such as a u s nine zero zero number and leaves the line open costing the user hundreds of dollars in telephone bills malware tools and aids exploit an exploit is a piece of software that attacks a particular security vulnerability exploits are not necessarily malicious in intent they are often devised by security researchers as a way of demonstrating that a vulnerability exists however they are a common component of malicious programs such as network worms curing an infection unfortunately cleaning an operating system that has been infected by malware is no longer as simple as it used to be malware has become increasingly more difficult to clean as malware creators find more ways to avoid removal no single anti virus or anti spyware application can reliably successfully remove all malware that has been installed on a computer in fact it is not unusual to resort to an arsenal of security products online scanners and anti spyware virus software in an attempt to ensure everything has been properly removed furthermore there are many dubious anti malware products from those that are advertised by malware or those from creators who strike deals with malware creators to

muralitharan born april one seven one nine seven two in kandy often referred to simply as murali is a sri lankan cricketer a hugely successful off spin bowler he is generally recognised as the greatest sri lankan player and the greatest off spinner in cricket history since his international debut in one nine nine two he has enjoyed more success than any other spinner except shane warne and has become one of the most acclaimed cricketers of the modern age however in recent years he has been dogged by controversy over the legality of his unorthodox bowling action statistically there is no doubt that he is one of the most effective bowlers ever to play cricket in both international forms of the game test and one day internationals currently his test record stands at almost six zero zero wickets at an average of just two two five this compares favourably to other contemporary spin bowlers shane warne s bowling average is two five two anil kumble s two eight eight and fellow off spinner harbhajan singh s two nine five in two zero zero two wisden named him the greatest bowler of all time in may two zero zero four in zimbabwe he overtook west indian courtney walsh s record of five one nine test match wickets to become the highest wicket taker of all time warne an australian leg spinner is his only current rival for that record indeed he overtook muralitharan s number of wickets in late two zero zero four warne believes that the younger muralitharan will eventually be the one to finish with the record saying he believes that muralitharan will take one zero zero zero wickets in truth an unlikely achievement before he retires muralitharan s unorthodox bowling action begins with a unique flapping wings run up complete with bulging eyes and culminates with an extremely wristy delivery which he claims often had him mistaken for a leg spinner early in his career he generates a prodigious amount of turn in addition to the flighting of the ball that is very hard for a batsman to play at aside from his off break he also a bowls a fast topspinner which goes straight on and his own interpretation of saqlain mushtaq s controversial doosra delivery which turns from leg to off murali became politically active in two zero zero four becoming an ambassador for the united nations world food program and joining an anti poverty campaign he said he was lucky to be alive after narrowly missing the two zero zero four indian ocean earthquake by just two zero minutes one week later he was reported to be helping distribute food to victims of the tsunami he is one of two tamils in the sri lankan cricket team the other being russel arnold there has long been ethnic tension in sri lanka between the minority tamil and the majority sinhalese communities and some members of the tamil community feel that muralitharan should not play for the sri lankan national team muralitharan married an indian woman mathimalar ramamurthy in two zero zero five world records and achievements muttiah muralitharan holds a number of world records and several firsts the highest number of international wickets tests and odis ever by an off spinnner held the world record for the highest wickets in test matches for a brief period he is the only bowler to cross one zero zero zero wickets both forms of the game put together most number of one zero wicket hauls in a match at test level he also holds the dubious record of conceding the maximum number of runs in an odi match without taking a single wicket which also happens to be the most number of runs given away in the five zero over version of the game his figures were zero nine nine controversy of bowling action poster of the united peoples freedom alliance supporting muralitharan on the bowling issue muralitharan s bowling action is controversial amongst many purists as to some it appears that it contravenes the laws of the game by straightening the arm in the course of the delivery this is despite his action being exonerated unanimously by an international panel consisting of members from every test playing nation the controversy came to a head after australian umpire darrell hair called a no ball for an illegal action seven times during the boxing day test match in melbourne australia in one nine nine five after discussions between the australian cricket board and the board of control for cricket in sri lanka hair umpired no further games involving sri lanka in the season reaction to hair s actions was mixed he was widely criticised in sri lanka and elsewhere but some particularly in australia felt that it was long overdue it would be simplistic to assume that opinion was divided purely by nationality though with australia s greatest ever cricketer sir donald bradman quoted as saying it was the worst example of umpiring that he had witnessed and against everything the game stands for clearly murali does not throw the ball muralitharan was later no balled for throwing by australian umpires ross emerson and tony mcquillan in a one day international against the west indies in brisbane australia in the same summer following this season muralitharan underwent biomechanical tests in hong kong and australia under the supervision of bowling experts who cleared his action as legal citing a congenital defect in muralitharan s arm which makes him incapable of straightening it but giving the appearance of the arm straightening in the bowling action doubts about muralitharan s action persisted particularly in australia in one nine nine nine he was once again called for throwing by umpire ross emerson in an odi against england at the adelaide oval in australia the sri lankan team almost abandoned the match but after instructions from the president of the bccsl relayed to captain arjuna ranatunga by mobile phone the game resumed muralitharan took his five zero zero th test wicket in the second test against australia in kandy on march one six two zero zero four at the end of the series his doosra delivery was officially called into question by match referee chris broad and muralitharan was entered into a two stage remedial process for bowlers with suspect actions under the supervision of the international cricket council icc the delivery was examined by biomechanical experts who found it to exceed the current tolerance limit regarding the degree of bend in the arm of five degrees for slow bowlers australian prime minister john howard weighed in controversially labelling murali a chucker despite this he won accolades from former australian captain steve waugh who said he was the don bradman of bowling waugh went on to say that he felt muralitharan s action was perfectly legal bowling action of muttiah muralitharan muralitharan has subsequently been videotaped bowling while wearing an arm brace that prevents the straightening of the arm in an attempt to clear his name once and for all it appears unlikely that this will ever happen as his critics maintain that only his bowling during real matches can be considered and that it s possible he changes his action when under scrutiny some experts who have viewed such tests have dismissed their value former indian spinner bishan bedi has been particularly vocal in his criticism of the testing asking why should a bowler be allowed to chuck because he has a defective arm and comparing muralitharan s action with that of javelin thrower there is speculation that the match referee s actions were an attempt to derail muralitharan s attempt to become the all time leading wicket taker former players like arjuna ranatunga believe this to be a white conspiracy with some australians and englishmen wishing to get the name muralitharan expunged from cricket records ranatunga asserted that muralitharan was being picked on because of his skin colour ranatunga s actions were seen by some as an attempt to deflect inquiries over muralitharan s action by branding those making such claims with the pejorative term racist it should be noted that muralitharan has many powerful allies in australia and england examples include mark nicholas bruce yardley and steve waugh all of whom have supported muralitharan publicly it is claimed that sir donald bradman also spoke very highly of muralitharan an extensive icc study the results of which were released in november two zero zero four was conducted to investigate the chucking issue a panel of former test players with the assistance of several biomechanical experts revealed that nine nine of all bowlers bent their arms when bowling only one player in the world batsman ramnaresh sarwan did not transgress the rules when tested muralitharan s off break and topspinner were deemed within the rules two to five degree straightening but the doosra was still an area of concern the flexion measured when bowling the doosra was not excessive however considering the amount of flexion in the actions of many other bowlers the panel has recommended that the current law be expanded to extend the tolerance limit on the degree of bending to one five degrees for all bowlers if these findings are implemented then muralitharan s doosra would be deemed legal this scientific evidence has gone a long way to convincing many of muralitharan s former critics that his action is legal two vocal critics of murilatharan s action were former test cricketers west indian michael holding a member of the icc s advisory panel on illegal deliveries and australian dean jones holding had been quoted as being in one one zero agreement with bedi regarding muralitharan s action and jones had said by my interpretation i think he throws it following the icc study and the video analysis of muralitharan s action

british speed heavy metal band the name was derived from a slang term for an amphetamine user founded by ex hawkwind bassist lemmy kilmister in one nine seven five the band specialises in songs that are extremely loud to the unaccustomed listener this is reflected in the title of one of the band s live albums everything louder than everyone else while the band are typically classified as heavy metal or speed metal kilmister has refused such labels preferring to describe mot rhead s style as rock and roll their sound tends to be half metal half punk and half rock n roll purposely three halves of a band mot rhead s lyrics cover such topics as war good versus evil abuse of power promiscuous sex substance abuse and life on the road the latter is portrayed in songs like we are the road crew iron horse and keep us on the road history after being sacked from hawkwind in one nine seven five supposedly for doing the wrong drugs kilmister decided to form a new band originally to be called bastard realising that this would preclude them from commercial acceptance he eventually settled on mot rhead after a song he had written for hawkwind his stated aim was for the outfit to be the dirtiest rock n roll band in the world the first line up of the band featured larry wallis ex pink fairies on guitar and lucas fox on drums their first gig was at the roundhouse london on july two zero one nine seven five they recorded sessions at rockfield studios in monmouth during which fox left to be replaced by drum virtuoso phil philthy animal taylor the sessions did not see the light of day until they were opportunistically released in one nine seven nine once the band was becoming popular deciding that two guitarists were required the band recruited fast eddie clarke but wallis left during the auditions and so the idea was shelved the classic line up from left to right philthy animal taylor lemmy kilmister and fast eddie clarke the trio of kilmister clarke and taylor is today regarded as the classic mot rhead line up initial reactions to the band were unfavourable they memorably won a poll for worst band in the world in one music magazine the band s first official album release was the self titled mot rhead released in one nine seven seven by this time the standard of their performances had improved considerably and the uncompromising nature of their music was beginning to garner a following from enthusiasts of both metal and punk follow up albums overkill and bomber cemented their reputation as one of britain s foremost heavy metal groups in the early one nine eight zero s they had uk top four zero chart hits with singles and eps such as ace of spades mot rhead live iron fist the golden years and the st valentine s day massacre ep their collaboration

british english or a conservatorium australian english is an institution dedicated to teaching the art of music including the playing of musical instruments musical composition musicianship music history and music theory most music schools are tertiary level institutions and they may either be independent or part of a university many music schools originated as vocational training centres for would be professional musicians often outside the main academic structure these institutions have retained an emphasis on performance into the two one st century while also adopting a more formal academic approach on the other hand there are university music departments which originally placed more emphasis on academic study of music but often place greater emphasis on performance now than they did in the past the two groups overlap more than they used to with the specific emphasis varying from one institution to another there are also some specialist music schools for school age

multiple possible universes including our universe that together comprise all of physical reality the structure of the multiverse the nature of each universe within it and the relationship between the various constituent universes depend on the specific multiverse hypothesis considered multiverses have been hypothesized in physics philosophy and fiction particularly in science fiction the specific term multiverse was popularised by science fiction author michael moorcock in these contexts such terms as alternate universes parallel universes or parallel worlds may often be used the possibility of many universes raises various scientific philosophical and theological questions multiverse hypotheses in physics classification according to max tegmark the existence of other universes is a direct implication of cosmological observations in a two zero zero three scientific american article parallel universes may issue he presents a clear and comprehensive summary tegmark describes the set of related concepts which share the notion that there are universes beyond the familiar observable one and goes on to provide a taxonomy of parallel universes organized by levels we shall briefly describe these levels then examine each in detail level i open multiverse a generic prediction of cosmic inflation is an infinite ergodic universe which being infinite must contain hubble volumes realizing all initial conditions including an identical copy of you about one zero meters away level ii andre linde s bubble theory in chaotic inflation other thermalized regions may have different effective physical constants dimensionality and particle content surprisingly this level includes wheeler s oscillating universe theory as well level iii hugh everett iii s many worlds interpretation an interpretation of quantum mechanics that proposes the existence of multiple universes all of which are identical but exist in possibly different states it is widely believed that everett s interpretation considered as a formal theory is a conservative extension of standard quantum mechanics that is as far as results expressible in the language of ordinary quantum mechanics is concerned it leads to no new results this according to tegmark is ironic given that this level has historically been the most controversial level iv the ultimate ensemble theory of tegmark other mathematical structures give different fundamental equations of physics this level considers real any hypothetical universe based on one of these structures m theory might be placed here since this subsumes all other possible ensembles it brings closure to the hierarchy of multiverses there cannot be a level v open multiverse alexander vilenkin with jaume garriga and others have recently argued that there are an infinite number of regions of space the same size as our observable universe that is that one can travel forever in any direction and always continue to reach new points this assumption relies on the theory that at some stage in the past matter was distributed fairly evenly across space and later condensed to form objects dense enough to become the source for a big bang however in this situation we would expect that rather than there being only a single big bang matter would condense in a number of places separated by astronomical distances forming a network or lattice of big bangs all exploding and then contracting like a network of flashing lights or the atoms in a crystal thus rather than having a single big bang and a single universe there would be a collection of universes or a multiverse bubble theory the formation of our universe from a bubble of a multiverse was proposed by andre linde this bubble universe theory fits well with the widely accepted theory of inflation the bubble universe concept involves creation of universes from the quantum foam of a parent universe on very small scales the foam is frothing due to energy fluctuations these fluctuations may create tiny bubbles and wormholes if the energy fluctuation is not very large a tiny bubble universe may form experience some expansion like an inflating balloon and then contract and disappear from existence however if the energy fluctuation is greater than a particular critical value a tiny bubble universe forms from the parent universe experiences long term expansion and allows matter and large scale galactic structures to form big bounce according to some quantum loop gravity theorists the big bang was merely the beginning of a period of expansion that followed a period of contraction in this oscillatory universe hypothesis originally attributable to john wheeler the universe undergoes an infinite series of oscillations each beginning with a big bang and ending with a big crunch after the big bang the universe expands for a while before the gravitational attraction of matter causes it to collapse back in and undergo a big bounce although the model was abandoned for a time the theory has been revived in brane cosmology as the cyclic model many world interpretation of quantum physics hugh everett s many worlds interpretation mwi is one of several mainstream interpretations of quantum mechanics other interpretations include the copenhagen and the consistent histories interpretations the multiverse proposed by mwi has a shared time parameter in most formulations all the constituent universes are structurally identical to each other and though they have the same physical laws and values for the fundamental constants they may exist in different states the constituent universes are furthermore non communicating in the sense that no information can pass between them the state of the entire multiverse is related to the states of the constituent universes by quantum superposition related are richard feynman s multiple histories interpretation and h dieter zeh s many minds interpretation m theory a multiverse of a somewhat different kind has been envisaged within the one one dimensional extension of string theory known as m theory in m theory our universe and others are created by collisions between membranes in an one one dimensional space unlike the universes in the quantum multiverse these universes can have completely different laws of physics anything may be possible string landscape another proposal for a multiverse in string theory this type iib string theory has received considerable attention lately it is called the string landscape and asserts that roughly speaking there are a very large number of ways to go from ten dimensional string theory down to the four dimensional low energy world we see and each one of these corresponds to a radically different universe arguments against multiverse theories it s not science critics claim that there is a lack of empirical correlation and testability in these theories and thus they are without hard physical evidence and must therefore be considered unfalsifiable currently outside the methodology of scientific investigation to confirm or disprove and therefore more mathematically theoretical and metaphysical than scientific in nature but tegmark points out improved measurements of the microwave background radiation and of the large scale distribution of matter may fortify or knock down two pillars of the multiverse the infinitude of space and the theory of chaotic inflation it s bad science some have argued that the job of the scientist is to provide fundamental explanations for observed phenomena without making reference to observers resorting to anthropic principles constitutes a lazy way out of accounting for features such as the apparent fine tuning of parameters in relation to the existence of life leonard susskind claims however that some form of multiverse is unavoidable given the current state of physics and that observer effects are inevitable and have to be taken into account in other sciences alternate universes violate occam s razor to postulate an infinity of unseen and unseeable universes just to explain the one we do see seems like a case of excess baggage carried to the extreme tegmark answers a common feature of all four multiverse levels is that the simplest and arguably most elegant theory involves parallel universes by default to deny the existence of those universes one needs to complicate the theory by adding experimentally unsupported processes and ad hoc postulates finite space wave function collapse and ontological asymmetry our judgment therefore comes down to which we find more wasteful and inelegant many worlds or many words thus paradoxically the multiverse scenario is more parsimonious than that of a single universe there is only one possible universe it is occasionally argued that the observed universe is the unique possible universe so that talk of other universes is ipso facto meaningless einstein raised this possibility when he wondered whether the universe could have been otherwise or non existent altogether the hope is sometimes expressed that once a fully unified theory of physics is achieved it will turn out to have a unique solution corresponding to the observed universe measures of fine tuning are meaningless the principal observational support for the multiverse hypothesis comes from the anthropic principle the universe we observe is bio friendly or we would not be observing it while this is a tautology when the sensitivity of biology to the form of the laws of physics and the cosmological initial conditions is considered it has some apparent credence but on the other hand many key parameters of physics do not seem to be very strongly constrained by biology another criticism of the fine tuning argument is that as far as we know there could be a more fundamental law under which the parameters of physics must have the values they do thus given such a law it is not improbable that the known parameters of physics fall within the life permitting range multiverses merely shift the problem up one level multiverse proponents are often vague about how the parameter values are selected across the defined ensemble if there is a law of laws or meta law describing how parameter values are assigned from one universe to the next then we have only shifted the central problems of cosmology up one level because we need to explain where the meta law comes from moreover the set of such meta laws is infinite so we have merely replaced the question why this universe with why this meta law there would seem to be little point in invoking an infinity of universes when it would be simpler to postulate a single universe with a single principle in tegmark s extreme multiverse theory this problem is circumvented because in that case all possible meta laws or all possible unified theories are in force and describe really existing multiverses the fake universe problem most scientists are prepared to entertain the possibility of conscious machines and some artificial intelligence advocates even claim we are not far from producing conscious computers it is then but a small step to the point where the engineered conscious beings inhabit a simulated world for such beings their fake universe will appear indistinguishable from reality so should we include these simulated universes in the ensemble that constitutes the multiverse is it meaningful to assign equal ontological status to our own observed universe and universes that are virtual if it is not then is it meaningful to assign equal ontological status to our own observed universe and universes that can never be observed by any sentient being why stop there the last objection to the existing multiverse theories is a challenge to the criteria for defining universes in most multiverse theories universes are labeled by laws of physics and initial conditions it might be objected that these terms are narrow and chauvinistic there may be criteria for categorization that lie completely beyond the scope of human comprehension multiverse hypotheses in philosophy anthropic principle the concept of other universes has been proposed to explain why our universe seems to be fine tuned for conscious life as we experience it if there were a large number possibly infinite of different physical laws or fundamental constants in as many universes some of these would have laws that were suitable for stars planets and life to exist the anthropic principle could then be applied to conclude that we would only consciously exist in those universes which were finely tuned for our conscious existence thus while the probability might be extremely small that there is life in most of the multiverses this scarcity of life supporting universes does not imply design is the only explanation of our existence the entire range of multiverse hypotheses with specific emphasis on hugh everett s many worlds interpretation have been criticised by proponents of intelligent design william dembski in particular derides it as inflating explanatory resources without evidence or warrant and terms such concepts inflatons recent pronouncements by church authorities suggest the catholic church now appears to reject all such hypotheses as well in what may be a reversal of a long standing hands off policy regarding the physical sciences see and for an alternate view now at the beginning of the two one st century faced with scientific claims like neo darwinism and the multiverse hypothesis in cosmology invented to avoid the overwhelming evidence for purpose and design found in modern science the catholic church will again defend human reason by proclaiming that the immanent design evident in nature is real christoph sch nborn modal realism additionally possible worlds are a way of explaining probability hypothetical statements and the like and some philosophers such as david lewis believe that all possible worlds actually exist a position known as modal realism this thesis is one of the central tenets of his book lewis one nine eight six trans world identity issues a metaphysical issue that crops up with multiverse schema that posit infinite identical copies of any given universe is that of the notion that there can be identical objects in different possible worlds the problem lies in the tension between classical notions of identity and quantum indeterminacy in short quantum reality does not allow classical radically mechanical identities due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle however in an infinite set of possible universes such a correspondence is presumed to exist the question then becomes whether one can claim a distinction between entities that vary only in terms of some arbitrary dimensional metric in de sitter space suggested resolutions include the possibilities that synchronous unitemporal parallel universe ontologies are invalid synchronous unitemporal parallel universes belong to a part whole relationship quantum fluctuations average out within the heisenberg limit between duplicates alternate criteria are needed to hermeneutically assess the concept of identity trans world identity is also considered in depth in possible worlds

middle east wars by region molotov cocktail also known as a petrol bomb benzine torch molotov grenade or a molotov bomb is the generic name for a variety of crude incendiary weapons commonly associated with irregular military forces and rioters they are more frequently used for basic arson in urban slang they are often referred to as a homemade frag how it works a molotov cocktail consists of a glass bottle partly filled with flammable liquid usually gasoline or alcohol methanol or ethanol the mouth of the bottle is stopped up with a cork or other type of airtight bung rubber glass or plastic and a cloth rag is fixed securely around the mouth the weapon is used by first soaking the rag in a flammable liquid immediately prior to using it lighting the rag and throwing the bottle at the target the bottle shatters on impact spilling the flammable liquid over the target which is then ignited by the burning rag common practice is to throw several full unlit bottles to saturate an area then to ignite the target with a lit one this avoids some of the risk of throwing several lit devices such as revealing the attacker s location missing the target or dropping the molotov cocktail many substances may be added to the basic molotov cocktail to enhance its use as a weapon self inflammatory materials such as white phosphorus may be used to guarantee the bottle s explosion as it hits the target surface tar palm oil laundry detergent liquid dish soap dissolved polystyrene sugar or other thickening agents are often added to make the burning fluid stick to the target tar also helps to make a thick black smoke in their wars with the soviet union finnish soldiers often used hand soap suds and tar for this purpose acid may be added to increase both the damage from the explosive device and its ability to penetrate fire resistant surfaces thermite can also be added to mixture inside the bottle to increase burn time and burn through many surfaces as a result of the molten iron created in the thermite reaction molotov cocktails are similar to napalm bombs in principle napalm short for na phthenic palm itic acids was originally made by combining flammable naphthalene and petrol with a thickening agent palmitic acid the latter two being the main ingredients of molotov cocktails according to che guevara s writings the ideal mixture for creating an anti personnel sheet of flame is three parts gasoline to one part motor oil this type of molotov may also be launched from a modified one six gauge shotgun history a mural in derry of a young boy in a gas mask holding a petrol bomb during the battle of the bogside august one nine six nine the name molotov cocktail is derived from vyacheslav mikhailovich molotov a soviet politician who was the people s commissar for foreign affairs foreign minister of the soviet union with an ironic reference to the one nine three zero s fashion for pre dinner cocktails during the buildup to world war ii when finland refused to surrender some land to the soviet union the soviets invaded the poorly equipped and heavily outnumbered finnish army facing red army tanks in what came to be known as the winter war borrowed an improvised incendiary device from the one nine three six three nine spanish civil war in that conflict the church and axis backed nationalists under general francisco franco had used the weapon against soviet t two six tanks supporting the spanish republicans in a failed one nine three six soviet assault near toledo three zero km from madrid when molotov claimed in radio broadcasts that the soviet union was not dropping bombs but rather delivering food to the starving finns the finns started to call the air bombs satirically molotov picnic baskets soon they responded by saluting the advancing tanks with molotov cocktails at first the term was used to describe only the burning mixture itself but in practical use the term was soon applied to the combination of both the bottle and its contents this finnish use of the hand or sling thrown explosive against soviet tanks was repeated in the subsequent continuation war molotov cocktails were eventually mass produced by the finnish military bundled with matches to light them these weapons saw widespread use by all sides in world war ii they were very effective against light tanks and very bad for enemy morale the following is a first hand description of their effects written during the warsaw ghetto uprising in one nine four three the well aimed bottles hit the tank the flames spread quickly the blast of the explosion is heard the machine stands motionless the crew is burned alive the other two tanks turn around and withdraw the germans who took cover behind them withdraw in panic we take leave of them with a few well aimed shots and grenades during the one nine four eight arab israeli war members of the israeli kibbutz degania managed to stop a syrian tank assault by using molotov cocktails they were frequently used against soviet tanks with great efficiency in the hungarian revolution of one nine five six molotov cocktails are much more effective against gasoline engines than diesel engines diesel is very viscous and has a high flashpoint of six four c making it much less flammable and runny compared to petrol the weapon has been used against tanks effectively because of the conformation of parts of tanks particularly around the undersides and fuel tank entrances a molotov cocktail will often blow up the gasoline tank destroying the machine particularly for older tank models some soviet tanks actually had an entry to the gas tank on the side of the vehicle which could be opened by combatants in close quarters letting out the highly flammable liquid and making destruction of the tank even easier note that these tactics were only effective due to the advantage guerrillas had in close quarters tanks can barely maneuver in such conditions and are not able to counter quick moving enemies armed with incendiary bombs petrol bombs were widely used throughout the troubles in northern ireland in riot situations directed towards the ruc or the british army as well as occasional situations where they continue to be used against the psni and army they are frequently used in sectarian attacks on homes and businesses by both communities fireworks and homemade grenades blast bombs now commonly accompany petrol bomb attacks on the security forces handling the easy construction of a molotov cocktail makes it a standard weapon of guerrilla warfare and violent rioters but it can be challenging for an amateur to make an effective device the most common failure is in over filling the bottle as a full bottle will not ignite quickly when it breaks on impact although it has a longer burning potential for a device to explode rapidly on impact the bottle should be only one half to two thirds full however one must consider whether the additional power is worth the risk of a premature explosion another common mistake is failing to wipe down the bottle which removes flammable residue prior to lighting the rag yet another error is to use the ignition rag directly to stopper the bottle other common difficulties include failing to make an airtight seal with the stopper to prevent escaping fumes a too long or too loosely secured ignition rag using an inappropriate bottle e g short necked wide mouthed too fragile or too tough and above all mishandling after the rag is ignited a common modification is to use a sealed bottle of flammable liquid still no more than two thirds full for example a liquor bottle with a screw on lid and tightly rubber band a tampon without applicator soaked in flammable liquid to the neck the feminine product holds a large quantity of liquid does not degrade due to the corrosiveness of the petrol and its lightweight aerodynamic shape causes less drag than would a rag using a sealed bottle prevents the thrower from dousing himself and those near him in flaming liquid when winding up to throw in order to easily transport the device the tampon can be wrapped in cellophane after being soaked in gasoline a cigarette lighter can easily burn through the cellophane and ignite the tampon at the moment of use it is thus possible for a woman carrying a bottle of liquor tampons a scarf cigarettes and lighter to be in the possession of deadly ingredients that would ordinarily arouse little suspicion in short molotov cocktails are inherently dangerous devices due to their incendiary or explosive nature the manufacture and use of molotov cocktails involves serious danger to the unskilled manufacturer legality as incendiary devices molotov cocktails are illegal to manufacture or possess in many regions their use against people is typically covered under a variety of charges including assault actual or grievous bodily harm manslaughter attempted murder and murder depending upon their effect and upon local laws their use against property is usually covered under arson charges in the united states molotov cocktails are considered destructive devices and regulated by the atf recent use molotov cocktails were put to use recently during the riotous two zero zero five civil unrest in france another situation with popularity for them is the palestinian intifada in sydney during the bondi riots rioters carrying molotov cocktails were apprehended when they carried open bottles in a bus the resulting smell of petrol alerted the driver who in turn alerted the police during the columbine high school massacre the two gunmen built and threw several molotov cocktails however none of them exploded it s presumed that this was due to their being overfilled references eyewitness reporting for the

plateau in montreal whose working class character and joual dialect would heavily influence his work tremblay s first play les belles s urs was written in one nine six five and premiered at the th tre du rideau vert on august two eight one nine six eight its impact was huge bringing down the old guard of canadian theatre and introducing joual to the mainstream it stirred up controversy by portraying the lives of working class women and attacking the strait laced deeply religious society of mid two zero th century quebec the most profound and lasting effects of tremblay s early plays including hosanna and la duchesse de langeais were the barriers they toppled in quebec society until the quiet revolution of the early one nine six zero s tremblay saw quebec as a poor working class province dominated by an english speaking elite and the catholic church tremblay s work was part of a vanguard of liberal nationalist thought that helped create an essentially modern society his most famous plays are usually centered on women characters the women are usually strong but possessed with demons they must vanquish it is said he sees quebec as a matriarchal society he is considered one of the best playwrights for women in the late one nine eight zero s les belles soeurs the sisters in law was produced in scotland in the scots language as the guid sisters guid sister being the scottish for sister in law his work has been translated into many languages including yiddish and including such works as sainte carmen de la main ta ton tour laura cadieux and forever yours marilou toi pour toujours ta marie lou he has always been openly gay and he has written many novels the duchess and the commoner la nuit des princes charmants and plays hosanna la duchesse de langeais centred on gay characters in a one nine eight seven interview with shelagh rogers for cbc radio s the arts tonight he remarked that he has always avoided behaviours he has considered masculine for example he does not smoke and he noted that he was four five years old and did not know how to drive a car i think i am a rare breed he said a homosexual who doesn t like men his latest play to receive wide accalaim is for the pleasure of seeing her again a funny and nostalgic play centered on the memories of his mother he later published the plateau mont royal chronicles a cycle of six novels including the fat woman next door is pregnant la grosse femme d c t est enceinte one nine seven eight and the duchess and the commoner la duchesse et le roturier one nine eight two the second novel of this

machine learning technique for creating a function from training data the training data consist of pairs of input objects typically vectors and desired outputs the output of the function can be a continuous value called regression or can predict a class label of the input object called classification the task of the supervised learner is to predict the value of the function for any valid input object after having seen a number of training examples i e pairs of input and target output to achieve this the learner has to generalize from the presented data to unseen situations in a reasonable way see inductive bias compare with unsupervised learning supervised learning can generate models of two types most commonly supervised learning generates a global model that maps input objects to desired outputs in some cases however the map is implemented as a set of local models such as in case based reasoning or the nearest neighbor algorithm in order to solve a given problem of supervised learning e g learning to recognize handwriting one has to consider various steps determine the type of training examples before doing anything else the engineer should decide what kind of data is to be used as an example for instance this might be a single handwritten character an entire handwritten word or an entire line of handwriting gathering a training set the training set needs to be characteristic of the real world use of the function thus a set of input objects is gathered and corresponding outputs are also gathered either from human experts or from measurements determine the input feature representation of the learned function the accuracy of the learned function depends strongly on how the input object is represented typically the input object is transformed into a feature vector which contains a number of features that are descriptive of the object the number of features should not be too large because of the curse of dimensionality but should be large enough to accurately predict the output determine the structure of the learned function and corresponding learning algorithm for example the engineer may choose to use artificial neural networks or decision trees complete the design the engineer then runs the learning algorithm on the gathered training set parameters of the learning algorithm may be adjusted by optimizing performance on a subset called a validation set of the training set or via cross validation after parameter adjustment and learning the performance of the algorithm may be measured on a test set that is separate from the training set empirical risk minimization the goal of supervised learning of a global model is to find a function g given a set of points of the form x g x it is assumed that the set of points for which the behavior of g is known is an i i d sample drawn according to an unknown probability distribution p of a larger possibly infinite population furthermore one assumes the existence of a task specific loss function l of type l y times y to bbb where y is the codomain of g and l maps into the nonnegative real numbers further restrictions may be placed on l the quantity l z y is the loss incurred by predicting z as the value of g at a given point when the true value is y the risk associated with a function f is then defined as the expectation of the loss function as follows r f sum i l f x i g x i p x i if the probability distribution p is discrete the analogous continuous case employs a definite integral and a probability density function the goal is now to find a function f among a fixed subclass of functions for which the risk r f is minimal however since the behavior of g is generally only known for a finite sequence of points x one y one x n y n one can only approximate the true risk for example with the empirical risk tilde n f frac sum n l f x i y i selecting the function f that minimizes the empirical risk is known as the principle of empirical risk minimization

executable code known as a macro for example a spreadsheet program may enable the user to embed macro commands in a spreadsheet file microsoft access is a relational database management system from microsoft packaged with microsoft office professional which combines the relational microsoft jet database engine with a graphical user interface it can use data stored in access jet sql server oracle or any odbc compliant data container skilled software developers and data architects use it to develop powerful complex application software relatively unskilled programmers and non programmer power users can use it to build simple applications without having to deal with features they don t understand it supports substantial object oriented oo techniques but falls short of being a fully oo development tool microsoft access was also the name of a communications program from microsoft meant to compete with procomm and other programs it proved a failure and was dropped years later they reused the name for their database software uses access is widely used by small businesses and hobby programmers to create ad hoc customized systems for handling small tasks its ease of use and powerful design tools give the non professional programmer a lot of power for little effort however this ease of use can be misleading this sort of developer is often an office worker with little or no training in application or data design because access makes it possible even for such developers to create usable systems many are misled into thinking that the tool itself is limited to such applications some professional application developers use access for rapid application development especially for the creation of prototypes and standalone applications that serve as tools for on the road salesmen access does not scale well if data access is via a network so applications that are used by more than a handful of people tend to rely on a client server based solution such as oracle db two microsoft sql server postgresql mysql or maxdb however an access front end the forms reports queries and vb code can be used against a host of database backends including access itself sql server oracle and any other odbc compliant product this approach allows the developer to move a matured application s data to a more powerful server without sacrificing the development already in place many developers who use microsoft access use the leszynski naming convention though this is not universal it is a programming convention not a dbms enforced rule features one of the benefits of access from a programmer s perspective is its relative compatibility with sql queries may be viewed and edited as sql statements and sql statements can be used directly in macros and vba modules to manipulate access tables users may mix and use both vba and macros for programming forms and logic and offers object oriented possibilities the report writer in access is similar to the other popular database

jet family of software products particularly as regards large projects access cut and paste functionality can make it a useful tool for connecting between other databases for example oracle and microsoft sql server during data or database conversions access comes with various import and export features that allow integration with windows and other platform applications several of which can be executed on demand from within applications or manually by the user for example the very compact snp format for sharing perfectly formatted reports with people who don t have the full access software it can also easily be upgraded to microsoft sql server unlike complete rdbmses it lacks database triggers and stored procedures it does allow forms to contain code that is triggered as changes are made to the underlying table and it is common to use pass through queries and other techniques in access to run stored procedures in rdbmss that support these development the programming language available in access is as in other products of the microsoft office suite microsoft visual basic for applications two database access libraries of com components are provided the legacy data access objects dao only available with access and the new activex data objects ado microsoft access is easily applied to small projects but scales inefficiently to large projects if applications are designed poorly all database queries forms and reports are stored in the database and in keeping with the ideals of the relational model there is no possibility of making a physically structured hierarchy with them one design technique is to divide an access application between data and programs one database should contain only tables and relationships while another would have all programs forms reports and queries and links to the first database tables unfortunately access allows no relative paths when linking so the development environment should have the same path as the production environment although you can write your own dynamic linker routine in vba that can search out a certain back end file by searching through the directory tree if it can t find it in the current path this technique also allows the developer to divide the application among different files so some structure is possible further reading database design for mere mortals by michael j hernandez access

a metabolic product to be used or stored by the cell or the initiation of another metabolic pathway then called a flux generating step many of these pathways are elaborate and involve a step by step modification of the initial substance to shape it into the product with the exact chemical structure desired overview metabolic pathways often have these common properties they are reversible usually because the first step is a committed step such as breakdown for the release of energy that runs in two directions the pathways are regulated usually by feedback inhibition or may be a cycle where the end product starts the reaction again such as the krebs cycle see below anabolic and catabolic pathways in eukaryotes are separated by either compartmentation or by the use of different enzymes and cofactors major metabolic pathways cellular respiration main article cellular respiration several distinct but linked metabolic pathways are used by cells to transfer the energy released by breakdown

or malthusian trap is a return to subsistence level conditions as a result of agricultural or in later formulations economic production being eventually outstripped by growth in population theories of malthusian catastrophe are very similar to the subsistence theory of wages the main difference is that the malthusian theories predict over several generations or centuries whereas the subsistence theory of wages predicts over years and decades traditional views in one seven nine eight thomas malthus published his now famous an essay on the principle of population describing his theory of quantitative development of human populations i think i may fairly make two postulata first that food is necessary to the existence of man secondly that the passion between the sexes is necessary and will remain nearly in its present state these two laws ever since we have had any knowledge of mankind appear to have been fixed laws of our nature and as we have not hitherto seen any alteration in them we have no right to conclude that they will ever cease to be what they now are without an immediate act of power in that being who first arranged the system of the universe and for the advantage of his creatures still executes according to fixed laws all its various operations assuming then my postulata as granted i say that the power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man population when unchecked increases in a geometrical ratio malthus one seven nine eight chapter one online series increasing in geometric progression are defined by the fact that the quotient of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant e g a populations has a average birth rate of say one two or in the malthusian world of the one eight th century maybe rather two three babies per population member in five zero years so the entire unchecked population will grow in a ratio of one two or two three per five zero years malthus assumed the grow of agrarian economics as linear the arithmetic ratio is defined so that any two successive members of the sequence have a constant difference if unchecked progressive growth can easily outrun linear growth even if the quotient between successive sequence members is only slightly larger than one zero so malthus concluded that the population will be naturally checked by misery vice or the like in natural development every phase of unchecked exponential progression possible e g when inhabiting new habitats or colonies e g on the american continent at malthus time or when recovering from wars and epidemic plagues will be followed by a catastrophe or misery and thus unlimited growth may even directly cause misery and vice malthus one seven nine eight chapter seven a probable cause of epidemics online neo malthusian theory neo malthusian theory argues that unless at or below subsistence level a population s fertility will tend to move upwards assume for example that a country has one zero breeding groups over time this country s fertility will approach that of its fastest growing group in the same way that f t a times one zero one t b times one zero two t mbox b ne zero will eventually come to resemble g t b times one zero two t regardless of how large the constant a is or how small the constant b is under subsistence conditions the fastest growing group is likely to be that group progressing most rapidly in agricultural technology however in above subsistence conditions the fastest growing group is likely to be the one with the highest fertility therefore the fertility of the country will approach that of its most fertile group this however is only part of the problem in any group some individuals will be more pro fertility in their beliefs and practices than others according to neo malthusian theory these pro fertility individuals will not only have more children but also pass their pro fertility on to their children meaning a constant selection for pro fertility similar to the constant evolutionary selection for fertility genes except much faster because of greater diversity according to neo malthusians this increase in fertility will lead to hyperexponential population growth that will eventually outstrip growth in economic production this appears to make any sort of voluntary fertility control futile in the long run neo malthusians argue that although adult immigrants who at the very least arrive with human capital contribute to economic production there is little or no increase in economic production from increased natural growth and fertility neo malthusians argue that hyperexponential population growth has begun or will begin soon in developed countries to this can be added that unknown to malthus farmland deteriorates with use some areas where there was intensive agriculture in classic times had already declined in population because their farmland was worn out long before he wrote non occurrence of the catastrophe at the time malthus wrote most societies had populations at or near their agricultural limits but by the late two zero th century the new agricultural technologies of the green revolution had greatly expanded agricultural production throughout the world exponential not arithmetic growth rate as malthus believe for food production and that what he termed misery war political unrest and other forms of population control would lower population far before the famine he believed would occur of malthus s misery and vice the most powerful factors were population control that many do not deem to be miserable or sinful despite thomas malthus s opinions most technologically developed countries had by this time passed through the demographic transition a complex social development in which total fertility rates drop drastically in response to lower infant mortality more education of women increased urbanization and a wider availability of effective birth control by the end of the two zero th century these countries could avoid population declines only by permitting large scale immigration on the assumption that the demographic transition would spread to less developed countries the united nations population fund estimated that human population would peak in the late two one st century rather than continue to grow until it exhausted available resources another problem is that there is no strong evidence that the human population nor any real population actually follows exponential growth in plant or animal populations that are claimed to show exponential growth closer examination invariably shows that the supposedly exponential curve is actually the lower limb of a logistic curve or a section of a lotka volterra cycle also examination of records of estimated total world human population shows at best very weak evidence of exponential growth a chart of estimated world population one eight zero zero two zero five zero only the section in blue is made up of reliable counts and not estimates the annual increase graph does not appear as one would expect for exponential growth for exponential growth it should itself be an upward trending exponential curve whereas it has actually been trending downward since one nine eight six also the rate of increase should increase whereas of the increase between the early one nine five zero s and today five sixths occurred in the one nine five zero s and the first half of the one nine six zero s presumably attributable to the green revolution it then rose to a peak in one nine eight nine and has since declined to levels approaching those of one nine seven zero a chart of changes in world population one nine five two two zero zero two though short term trends even on the scale of decades or centuries do not necessarily disprove the underlying mechanisms promoting a malthusian catastrophe over longer periods the relative prosperity of the human population at the beginning of the two one st century and the apparent failure of spectacular predictions of mass starvation or ecological collapse made by activists such as paul r ehrlich in the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s has led many people such as economist julian l simon to question its inevitability application to energy resource consumptions another way of applying the malthusian theory is to substitute other resources such as sources of energy for food and resource energy consumption for population since modern food production is energy and resource intensive this is not a big jump most of the criteria for applying the theory are still satisfied since resources energy consumption is increasing much faster than population and most of our resources energy comes from polluting and non renewable sources the catastrophe

line slideshow to stop human overpopulation exponentials futurology population millennialism or chiliasm from millennium which literally means thousand years is primarily a belief expressed in some christian denominations and literature that there will be a golden age or paradise on earth where christ will reign prior to the final judgment and future eternal state primarily derived from the book of revelation two zero one six millennialism as such is a specific form of millenarianism in christianity this is not the end of the world but the penultimate age prior to when it is believed that the world will end some believe that between the millennium and the final end of the world there will be a brief period to allow a final battle with satan or a time of the anti christ followed by the last judgment millennialism is also a doctrine of zoroastrianism concerning successive thousand year periods each of which will end in a cataclysm of heresy and destruction until the final destruction of evil and of the spirit of evil by a triumphant king of peace at the end of the final millennial age supposed by some to be the year two zero zero zero then soshyant makes the creatures again pure and the resurrection and future existence occur zand i vohuman yasht three six two various other social and political movements both religious and secular have also been linked to millennialist metaphors by scholars the early church and premillennialism chiliasm millenarianism became the general belief of the time and met with almost no other opposition than that given by the gnostics gieseler church history vol one p one six six the early fathers lived in expectation of our lord s speedy return they distinguish between a first resurrection of the saints and a second or general resurrection these they supposed would be separated by a period of a thousand years during which christ should reign over the saints in jerusalem while the church was alternately persecuted and contemptuously tolerated by the roman empire the belief in christ s speedy return and his millennial reign was widely entertained when the church was recognized and patronized by the state the new order of things seemed so desirable that the close of the dispensation ceased to be expected or desired crispen history of doctrine p two three one two three two immediately after the triumph of constantine christianity having become dominant and prosperous christians began to lose their vivid expectation of our lord s speedy advent and to look upon the temporal supremacy of christianity as a fulfillment of the promised reign of christ on earth smith new testament history p two seven three tertullian commodian lactantius methodius and apollinaris of laodicea all advocated premillennial doctrine in addition according to religious scholar rev and dr francis nigel lee the following is true justin s occasional chiliasm sui generis which was strongly anti pretribulationistic was followed possibly by pothinus in a d one seven five and more probably around one eight five by irenaeus around two two zero there were some similar influences on tertullian though only with very important and extremely optimistic if not perhaps even postmillennial modifications and implications on the other hand christian chiliastic ideas were indeed advocated in two four zero by commodian in two five zero by the egyptian bishop nepos in his refutation of allegorists in two six zero by the almost unknown coracion and in three one zero by lactantius melito of sardis is frequently listed as a second century proponent of premillennialism the support usually given for the supposition is that jerome comm on ezek three six and gennadius de dogm eccl ch five two both affirm that he was a decided millenarian christian millennialism following the reformation christian views on the future order of events diversified after the protestant reformation in particular new emphasis was placed on the passages in the book of revelation which seemed to say that satan would be locked away for one zero zero zero years but then released on the world in a final battle rev two zero one six previous catholic and orthodox theologians had no clear or consensus view on what this actually meant only the concept of an end of the world coming unexpected like a thief in a night and the concept of the antichrist were almost universally held millennialist theories try to explain what this one zero zero zero years of satan in chains would be like various types of millennialism exist with regard to christian eschatology especially within protestantism such as premillennialism postmillennialism and amillennialism the first two refer to different views of the relationship between the millennial kingdom and christ s second coming premillennialism sees christ s second advent as preceding the millennium thereby separating the second coming from the final judgment in this view christ s reign will be physical postmillennialism see s christ s second coming as subsequent to the millennium and consequent with the final judgment in this view christ s reign during the millennium will be spiritual in and through the church amillennialism basically denies a future literal one zero zero zero year kingdom and sees the church age metaphorically described in rev two zero one six in this view christ s reign is current in and through the church pre christian millennialism although never officially recognized by the catholic church and actually pronounced a heresy as early as four three one ad millennialism which had clearly already existed in jewish thought received a new interpretation and fresh impetus with the arrival of christianity a millennium is a period of one thousand years and in particular christ s thousand year rule on this earth either directly preceding or immediately following the second coming and the day of judgement the millennium reverses the previous period of evil and suffering it rewards the virtuous for their courage while punishing the evil doers with a clear separation of saints and sinners the vision of a thousand year period of bliss for the faithful to be enjoyed here on earth heaven on earth exerted an irresistible power although the picture of life in the millennial era is almost willfully obscure and hardly more appealing than that of say the golden age what has made the millennium much more powerful than the golden age or paradise myths are the activities of the sects and movements that it has inspired throughout the ages hundreds of sects were convinced that the millennium was imminent about to begin in the very near future with precise dates given on many occasions premillennial sects look for signs of christ s imminent return other chiliast sects such as the prophetic anabaptist followers of thomas m ntzer have believed that the millennium had already begun with only their own members having realized this fact consequently they have attempted to live out their own vision of millennial life radically overturning the beliefs and practices of the surrounding society in doing so they offered a model of the good life and expressed their hope that soon the rest of the world would follow and live like they did see christian eschatology for a discussion of premillennialism and postmillennialism transition to the millennium millennial sects have typically believed that the transition from the present age to the millennium would be anything but smooth with the antichrist having to be defeated and jesus reign on earth having to be established millennial theories differ as to whether the battle with the antichrist will occur before or after the one zero zero zero years leaders of some movements have seen it as their responsibility to bring about the expected disastrous wars which would bring an end to the present age based on revelation two zero three some believe satan s millennial rebellion will occur after the one zero zero zero year peace on the other hand those who did not believe in the millennium also imagined the end of the world as chaotic and catastrophic the word apocalypse has been used for this final phase of human history as we know it with armageddon as the site of the last decisive battle on the day of judgement an or the apocalypse from greek apo off from away un and kalyptein cover is in the judeo christian tradition a revelation of god s purposes with the main intention of encouraging an oppressed and suffering minority to have faith in god and of proclaiming his ultimate triumph in particular the revelation of the future granted to st john one of the four evangelists in the isle of patmos written in greek in the one st century ad and burning with the conviction that the world is about to be destroyed and that christ s second coming is at hand hence the last book of the new testament the revelation of st john the book of revelation which contains it hence the total destruction and end of the world the book of revelation is not easy to interpret numerous painters and sculptors have produced works of art dealing with the apocalypse for example they portrayed the four horsemen of the apocalypse symbolizing pestilence war famine and death millennialism and utopianism the early christian concept had ramifications far beyond strictly religious concern during the centuries to come as it was blended and enhanced with ideas of utopia in the wake of early millennial thinking the three ages philosophy drei reiche lehre developed making use of the dogma of the trinity the italian monk and theologian joachim of fiore d one two zero two claimed that all of human history was a succession of three ages the age of the father the old testament the age of the son the new testament the age of the holy spirit the age of love peace and freedom it was believed that the age of the holy spirit would begin at around one two six zero and that from then on all believers would be living as monks mystically transfigured and full of praise for god for a thousand years until judgement day would put an end to the history of our planet in the modern era with the impact of religion on everyday life gradually decreasing and eventually almost vanishing some of the concepts of millennial thinking have found their way into various secular ideas usually in the form of a belief that a certain historical event will fundamentally change human society or has already done so for example the french revolution seemed to many to be ushering in the millennial age of reason also the philosophies of georg wilhelm friedrich hegel d one eight three one and karl marx d one eight eight three carried strong millennial overtones as late as one nine seven zero yale law teacher charles a reich coined the term consciousness iii in his best seller the greening of america in which he spoke of a new age ushered in by the hippie generation however these secular theories generally have little or nothing to do with the original millennial thinking or with each other millennialism and nazism the most controversial interpretation of the three ages philosophy and of millennialism in general is hitler s third reich drittes reich tausendj hriges reich which in his vision would last for a thousand years but which in reality only lasted for one two years one nine three three one nine four five the phrase third reich was coined by the conservative german thinker arthur moeller van den bruck who in one nine two three published a book entitled das dritte reich which eventually became a catchphrase that survived the nazi regime looking back at german history two periods were distinguished the holy roman empire beginning with charlemagne in ad eight zero zero the first reich and the german empire under the hohenzollern dynasty one eight seven one one nine one eight the second reich these were now to be followed after the interval of the weimar republic one nine one eight one nine three three during which constitutionalism parliamentarism and even pacifism ruled by the third reich of adolf hitler in a speech held on two seven november one nine three seven hitler commented on his plans to have major parts of berlin torn down and rebuilt einem tausendj hrigen volk mit tausendj hriger geschichtlicher und kultureller vergangenheit f r die vor ihm liegende unabsehbare zukunft eine ebenb rtige tausendj hrige stadt zu bauen to build a millennial city adequate in splendour to a thousand year old people with a thousand year old historical and cultural past for its never ending glorious future millennialism and social movements outside of theology the hitler s nazi movement has been described as millennial or millenarian in scholarly works millennial social movements are a specific form of millenarianism that are based on some concept of a one thousand year cycle sometimes the two terms are used as synonyms but this is not entirely accurate for a purist millennial social movements need not be religious but they must have a vision of an apocalypse that can be utopian or distopian references might and magic mm is a series of

the majority of the gameplay takes place in a medieval fantasy setting the player controls a party of player characters which can consist of members of various character classes the game world is presented to the player in first person perspective in the earlier games the interface is very similar to that of bard s tale but from might and magic vi the mandate of heaven onward the interface features a scrolling three dimensional environment similar to that of doom combat is turn based though the later games allowed the player to choose to conduct combat in real time the game worlds in all of the might and magic games are quite large and a player can expect each game to provide several dozen hours of gameplay it is usually quite combat intensive and often involves large groups of enemy creatures monsters encountered tend to be well known fantasy staples such as giant rats medusas dragons and zombies rather than original creations plot although most of the gameplay reflects a

refers to both the macromedia flash player and to a multimedia authoring program used to create content for it the flash player developed and distributed by adobe systems formerly by macromedia is a client application available in most web browsers it features support for vector and raster graphics a scripting language called actionscript and bidirectional streaming of audio and video strictly speaking macromedia flash is the integrated development environment ide and flash player is the virtual machine used to run the flash files but in colloquial language these have become mixed flash can mean either the authoring environment the player or the application files since its introduction in one nine nine six flash technology became a popular alternative to add animation and interactivity to web pages and several software products systems and devices feature flash content display or creation capabilities flash is commonly used to create animations advertisements design elements on a web page add video to web sites and more recently to develop rich internet applications the flash files traditionally called flash movies usually have a swf file extension and may appear as an element of a web page or to be played in the standalone flash player history in december one nine nine six macromedia acquired a vector based animation software called futuresplash and later released it as flash one zero macromedia flash two was released in one nine nine seven with features such as support of stereo sound and enhanced bitmap integration initially the flash player plug in was not bundled with popular web browsers and users had to visit macromedia website to download it but as of year two zero zero zero the flash player was already being distributed with all aol netscape and internet explorer browsers two years later it shipped with all releases of windows xp in october two zero zero zero usability guru jakob nielsen wrote a polemic article regarding usability of flash content

actionscript two zero in macromedia flash mx professional two zero zero four in mac os x one zero two the code creates a customizable animation similar to the one seen during the boot process of mac os x initially focused on animation early versions of flash content offered few interactivity features and thus had very limited scripting capability more recent versions include actionscript a scripting language which has syntax similar to javascript but a much different programming framework and set of class libraries actionscript is used to create almost all of the interactivity buttons text entry fields pick lists seen in many flash applications new versions of the flash player and authoring tool have strived to improve on scripting capabilities flash mx two zero zero four introduced actionscript two zero a scripting programming language more suited to the development of flash applications as seen in the image to the right it s often possible to save a lot of time by scripting something rather than animating it which usually also retains a higher level of editability user privacy flash can retain information locally in a manner similar to but more extensive than browser cookies giving the client the ability to for example remember the level or score a user has achieved on a flash based game or the settings used on a previously visited website this can potentially compromise the security of users data and privacy and there have been reports of exploitation by advertisers for example persistent information element most users including those familiar with flash who protect themselves from cookies are unaware of this kind of tracking which is not curtailed by customary in browser cookie settings and most cookie cleaning utilities the default

the internet susceptible to attacks specially crafted files could potentially cause the application to malfunction by allowing execution of malevolent code in november two zero zero five a security flaw in a certain windows versions of the flash player all version six players and version seven players up to seven zero one nine zero are affected was published this vulnerability could allow remote code execution however from version eight on this security problems have been fixed and flash player is allowed accessing files only locally or remotely but not both at the same time flash content protection many times flash authors will decide that while they desire the advantages that flash affords them in the areas of animation and interactivity they don t wish to expose their images and or code to the world once a swf file is saved locally it can then quite easily be decompiled into its source code and assets some decompilers are capable of nearly full reconstruction of the original source file down to the actual code that was used during creation in opposition to the decompilers swf obfuscators have been introduced to provide a modicum of security some produced by decompiler authors themselves the higher quality obfuscators use traps for the decompilers making some fail but none have definitively been shown to protect all content competition format and plug in compared to other plugins such as java acrobat reader quicktime or windows media player the flash player has very small install size and fast initialization time however detecting and embedding flash player in x html is not w three c compliant external links flash w three c valid the use of vector graphics like postscript svg and pdf especially when combined with program code allows flash files to translate to small file sizes which take less bandwidth to transmit than bitmaps or video clips do in many cases flash is a very attractive solution for delivering mixed content if the content is purely one format such as text video or audio other alternatives may provide better outcome also depending on the type of application or animation created in particular transparency or large screen updates as in photographic or text fades a flash movie may need more cpu power than alternatives in addition to a vector rendering engine the flash player includes a virtual machine called the actionscript virtual machine avm for scripting interactivity at run time support for video mp three based audio and bitmap graphics as of flash player eight it offers two video codecs on two vp six and sorenson spark and run time support for jpeg progressive jpeg png and gif flash as a format has become very widespread on the desktop market according to npd study nine eight of web users have the flash player installed with four five five six depending on region having the latest version numbers vary depending on the detection scheme and research demographics flash players exist for a wide variety of different systems and devices flash content can run consistently on microsoft windows mac os linux i three eight six only and various other unix systems macromedia has created or licensed players for the following operating systems gnu linux x eight six windows mac os nine x solaris hp ux pocket pc os two symbian palm os beos and irix olivier debon has written an open source version of the flash three player ports of this exist to numerous operating systems including the amiga see also macromedia flash lite for flash compatibility on other devices macromedia has released the specifications of the flash file format excluding specifications of related formats such as amf and compatible third party tools exist however macromedia retains control of the format since flash files do not depend on a truly open standard such as svg this reduces the incentive for non commercial software to support the format although there are several third party tools which utilize and generate the swf file format and a large and vibrant open source community apparently the flash player cannot ship as part of a pure open source or completely free operating system as its distribution is bound to the macromedia licensing program and subject to approval authoring using macromedia flash eight bundled in studio eight in windows xp in october one nine nine eight macromedia disclosed the flash version three specification to the world on its website it did this in response to many new and often semi open formats competing with swf such as xara s flare and sharp s extended vector animation formats several developers quickly created a c library for producing swf february one nine nine nine saw the launch of morphink nine nine the first non macromedia or third party program to create swf files macromedia also hired middlesoft to create a freely available developers kit for the swf file format versions three to five many open and free libraries based on the information released to the public in one nine nine eight and from later study of the swf file format such as the ming library exist to produce swf files on many platforms macromedia has made the flash files specifications for versions six and later available only as a pdf under a non disclosure agreement but is widely available from various sites many shareware developers produced flash creation tools and sold them for under five zero usd between two zero zero zero and two zero zero two in two zero zero three competition and the emergence of free flash creation tools most notably openoffice org had driven many third party flash creation tool makers out of the market allowing the remaining developers to raise their prices although many of the products still cost less than one zero zero usd and support actionscript as for open source tools flash four linux has started to develop a swf authoring tool including an interface similar to that of macromedia s ktoon can edit vectors and generate swf but its interface is very different from macromedia s adobe wrote a software package called adobe livemotion designed to create interactive animation content and export it to a variety of formats including swf livemotion went through two major releases but failed to gain any notable user base adobe cancelled it in two zero zero three in february two zero zero three macromedia purchased presidia which had developed a flash authoring tool that automatically converted powerpoint files into flash macromedia subsequently released the new product as breeze which included many new enhancements since that time macromedia has seen competing powerpoint to flash authoring tools from articulate pointecast not to be confused with pointcast and presentationpro in addition as of version two apple s keynote presentation software also allows users to create interactive presentations and export to swf in november two zero zero three microsoft announced that it had started working on a competing product now called microsoft expression interactive designer whose release would coincide with that of their next generation windows operating system windows vista although the target audiences of expression interaction designer and flash overlap somewhat microsoft is targeting its product on creating user interfaces for windows presentation foundation programs while flash focuses on user interfaces that run on many platforms primarily over the web abuse probably due to wide usage of flash in web advertisements tools have emerged for blocking flash content in some or all web sites or temporarily or permanently turning flash player off for example flashblock johnhaller com s disable flash uninstall flash page and adblock for the mozilla firefox browser many web sites rely on flash being available by default on your browser and will not check if you have disabled it you may be unable to access a particular website if you disable flash or experience a degraded user interface macintosh performance macromedia has been criticized for neglecting to optimize its products on the mac os x platform this has led to poor web surfing performance on macintosh computers since many websites use flash animations for menus and advertisements macromedia has rewritten the bitmap drawing routines in flash player eight using opengl planes via quartz to draw the surfaces the new drawing code is reported to be actually faster

control is a general term for a number of controversial theories proposing that an individual s thinking behavior emotions or decisions can to a greater or lesser extent be manipulated at will by outside sources the principal feasibility of such control and the methods by which it might be attained either direct or more subtle are both subject to hot debates among psychologists neuroscientists and sociologists also the exact definition of mind control and the extent of its influence on the individual are debated the different views on the subject do have legal implications mind control was an issue e g in the court case of patty hearst and also in several court cases regarding new religious movements also questions of mind control are regarding ethical questions linked to the subject of free will the question of mind control has been discussed in relation with religion politics prisoners of war totalitarianism neural cell manipulation cults terrorism torture parental alienation and even in regards to the battered woman syndrome while mind control remains a controversial subject the principal possibility of influences on individuals by methods like advertising media manipulation propaganda group dynamics or peer pressure has been well researched in social psychology and is today undisputed electromagnetic manipulation of neurons since the discovery that neural cells could be fired by establishing a potential voltage across a neural cell membrane in the one nine three zero s has been suggested as a technology the belief that one is being manipulated or controlled by outside forces is also recognized as one of the hallmarks of paranoid delusional complexes and other psychoses typically these delusions are of invasive and complete control by entities as diverse as orbiting government satellites television sets animals aliens or angels and demons those who suffer from this delusion may cling to it despite a complete lack of evidence of anything that might be controlling them psychiatric therapy with anti psychotic medication can often end the delusion or at least mitigate its severity in some cases however especially in cases of involuntary commitment the person may view treatment with anti psychotics as yet another form of mind control this should not be taken to imply that mere belief in the existence of mind control is an indicator of psychosis belief in the mere existence of mind control is wide spread it is only a sign of psychosis when the belief becomes an obsessive fixation theoretical models and methods there are several and very different methods which were suggested for achieving mind control none of these methods have been universally accepted in the science community theology ideology and identity authors joel kramer and diana alstad suggest that mind control is embedded in the very fabric of contemporary religious political and social power through the unquestioning reliance on false but ubiquituous authoritarian ideas they show how concepts such as religious truth goodness versus badness and unconditional love to name a few can be used to control and divide people s minds they also study the authoritarian programming by which so called normal people worldwide fall prey to status quo authoritarian ideas using well known guru mind control methods as a basis for comparison failed attempts drugs physical methods silva method the cia program mkultra made from one nine five zero tried to achieve mind control through drugs drugs used in experiments were lsd or heroin mescaline psilocybin scopolamine marijuana alcohol and sodium pentothal or a combination of barbiturates and amphetamine or ecstasy other theories have been based on the use of antidepressant drugs and mood stabilizers which have a definite effect on mood through what is believed to be a direct action on the chemistry of the brain however most people would not say that this constituted mind control and people taking these drugs do not feel controlled in the mkultra program radiation and electroshocks were tested but apparently did not achieve any sort of mind control with intense modern magnets and the technique of transcranial magnetic stimulation tms or repetitive tms rtms researchers have succeeded in transiently suppressing certain thought processes such as the conjugation of verbs with fleeting magnetic pulses to specific areas of the brain the technique has proved a valuable tool for testing hypotheses about the role and interplay between brain regions in particular cognitive activities and psychiatric symptoms such as depression tests with elf technology are better documented from the one nine five zero s to the one nine seven zero s both the soviet union and the united states carried out several experiments using elf pulse transmissions to mimic human nerve impulses in effect implanting certain states of consciousness particularly emotions by radiation scientists found that certain elf frequencies when transmitted in pulse mode could induce emotions in subjects any further going conclusions from these results belong rather in the field of conspiracy theories than of science but this too begs the question as it would be quite naive to assume no one has ever conspired to develop technologies useful for controlling others rauni leena luukanen kilde e g a former finnish physician and a well known ufologist and conspiracy theorist sees many schizophrenics as misdiagnosed victims of mind control experiments physical implants discovered in the cerebral tissue of such schizophrenics have allegedly substantiated such claims in the one nine six zero s jos silva made known the silva mind control method later silva method which uses a combination of positive thinking visualization meditation and self hypnosis and claims that its application can achieve psychic abilities remote viewing and healing none of which is empirically proven subliminal advertising outline subliminal advertising is an unproven method of mind control in which messages are relayed to the public by being hidden in broadcasted advertisements tv radio shows and movies subliminal advertising has been discovered often by chance in media around the world though it is denied some common methods include carefully wording a radio advertisement so your hear something different when it is played backwards the theory is that your brain registers the hidden message even though you don t realize it another common technique is to add one frame of video in the middle of a movie or tv show while it flashes by too quickly to be registered by your conscious your eyes still detect it and it registers in your brain one of the more serious sides of subliminal advertising is the fact that it is theoretically possible to control people s behaviour for example if a drinks company were to utilise it anyone watching or listening to the advert may be compelled to purchase that drink for a supposedly unknown reason it is also claimed it can control political ideology and even tendency to commit crime of course none of this has been proven but in the ruthless world of business some people will try anything subliminal advertising is the same as subliminal messaging although the latter is not designed to promote something james vicary coined the term subliminal advertising the publication in one nine five seven of vance packard s the hidden persuaders brought the term to the attention of the general public in one nine seven three the book subliminal seduction claimed that advertising made widespread use of subliminal techniques and could in theory be used as a form of mind control lifton brainwashing model psychiatrist robert lifton described in his one nine six one book thought reform and the psychology of totalism a study of brainwashing in china eight coercive methods which he says are able to change the minds of individuals without their knowledge and were used with this purpose on prisoners of war in korea and china these include milieu control controlled relations with the outer world mystic manipulation the group has a higher purpose than the rest

singer s conditions for mind control psychologist margaret singer using the work of lifton described in her book cults in our midst six conditions which would she says create an atmosphere where thought reform is possible singer sees no need for physical coercion or violence controlling a person s time and environment leaving no time for thought creating a sense of powerlessness fear and dependency manipulating rewards and punishments to suppress former social behaviour manipulating rewards and punishments to elicit the desired behaviour creating a closed system of logic which makes dissenters feel as if something was wrong with them keeping recruits unaware about any agenda to control or change them bite model of steven hassan psychologist and cult counselor steven hassan using the research of singer and lifton and the cognitive dissonance theory of leon festinger describes in his two zero zero zero book releasing the bonds the bite behavior information thought emotion model which explains mind control as a combination of control over behavior information thought and emotions according to hassan the bite model dispenses with any required environment control and its effects can be achieved when the control mechanisms create overall dependency and obedience to some leader or cause hassan s critics argue that steve hassan uses the term mind control for what they see as essentially a strong form of influence only to justify the forcible extraction of believers from religious groups they argue that hassan does not merely say that fraudulent salesmanship persuaded the believers he claims that these groups literally take away a victim s freedom of mind for this reason an involuntary procedure must operate in order to rescue a victim from a destructive cult for victims may not realize their victimhood status and may resist rescuing hassan after taking part in a number of deprogrammings in the late one nine seven zero s distances himself from this practice and the criminal activities associated with that occupation and refers to his method as strategic interaction mind control and the battered woman syndrome a very different explanation of the control some groups have over their members is by associating it to the battered woman syndrome this has been done by psychologists teresa ramirez boulette ph d and susan m andersen ph d as well as by former scientologist robert vaughn young evolutionary psychology approach battered women syndrome is an example of activating capture bonding capture bonding is understood in evolutionary psychology as an evolved response to capture in the last few million years cults such as scientology tap this psychological trait by abusive practices rpf that have the same paradoxical effect of bonding victims to the abusers in addition the intense attention rewards cults focus on members has brain effects nearly identical to drug addiction in some people social psychology tactics a contemporary view of mind control sees it as an intensified and persistent use of well researched social psychology principles like compliance conformity persuasion dissonance reactance framing or emotional manipulation one of the most notable proponents of this theory is social psychologist philip zimbardo former president of the american psychological association i conceive of mind control as a phenomena encompassing all the ways in which personal social and institutional forces are exerted to induce compliance conformity belief attitude and value change in others mind control is the process by which individual or collective freedom of choice and action is compromised by agents or agencies that modify or distort perception motivation affect cognition and or behavioral outcomes it is neither magical nor mystical but a process that involves a set of basic social psychological principles in influence science and practice social psychology researcher robert caildini shows how mind control is possible through the covert exploitation of the unconscious rules that underly and facilitate healthy human social interactions he notes the most common social rules that can be used to prey upon the unwary and titles them as follows reciprocation the old give and take and take commitment and consistency hobgoblins of the mind social proof truths are us liking the friendly thief authority directed deference scarcity the rule of the few using these six broad categories he shows many specific examples of both mild and extreme mind control both one on one and in groups notes the conditions under which each social rule is most easily exploited for false ends and offers suggestions on how to fight these insidious and often unconscious mind control methods social psychological conditioning by stahelski anthony stahelski identifies five phases of social psychological conditioning which he calls cult like conditioning techniques employed by terrorist groups stahelski two zero zero four depluralization stripping away all other group member identities self deindividuation stripping away each member s personal identity other deindividuation stripping away the personal identities of enemies dehumanization identifying enemies as subhuman or nonhuman demonization identifying enemies as evil cults and mind control controversies several of the above mind control models have been related to religious and non religious cults for debates regarding what is a cult see the article among scholars adherents of nrms and the pro cult and anti cult communities it is hotly debated if mind control is applied in any or certain cultic movements scholarly points of view while in science of religion the majority of scholars reject mind control e g massimo introvigne and j gordon melton it is often accepted in psychology and psychiatry e g margaret singer michael langone and philip zimbardo and in sociology the opinions are divided e g david g bromley and anson shupe contra stephen a kent and benjamin zablocki pro most scholars have either a decided contra or a decided pro opinion there are few who advocate a moderate point of view the renowned medical journal the lancet as well as the american journal of psychiatry published favorable reviews of steven hassan s one nine eight eight book on mind control according to james t richardson on his brainwashing claims and minority religions outside the united states cultural diffusion of a questionable concept in the legal arena while heavy on theory the mind control model is light on evidence the ccm movement has collected some information to support its belief that religious groups successfully employ mind control techniques but the data is unreliable the information typically represents a very small sample size it is not practical to obtain information before during and after an individual has been in a nrm often their data is disproportionately obtained from former members of a religious organization who have been convinced during ccm counseling that they have been victims of mind control dr james richardson a professor of sociology and judicial studies at the university of nevada claims that if the nrms had access to powerful brainwashing techniques one would expect that nrms would have high growth rates while in fact most have not had notable success in recruitment most adherents participate for only a short time and that the success in retaining members has been limited in addition thomas robbins eileen barker newton maloney massimo introvigne john hall lorne dawson anson shupe david g bromley gordon melton marc galanter saul levine and other scholars researching nrms have argued and established to the satisfaction of courts and relevant professional associations and scientific communities that there exists no scientific theory generally accepted and based upon methodologically sound research that supports the brainwashing theories as advanced by the anti cult movement on the other hand sociologist benjamin zablocki sees strong indicators of mind control in some nrms and demands the concept should be researched without bias i am not personally opposed to the existence of nrms and still less to the free exercise of religious conscience i would fight actively against any governmental attempt to limit freedom of religious expression nor do i believe it is within the competence of secular scholars such as myself to evaluate or judge the cultural worth of spiritual beliefs or spiritual actions however i am convinced based on more than three decades of studying nrms through participant observation and through interviews with both members and ex members that these movements have unleashed social and psychological forces of truly awesome power these forces have wreaked havoc in many lives in both adults and in children it is these social and psychological influence processes that the social scientist has both the right and the duty to try to understand regardless of whether such understanding will ultimately prove helpful or harmful to the cause of religious liberty zablocki one nine nine seven sociologists david bromley and anson shupe consider the idea that cult s are brainwashing american youth to be implausible on the other hand the canadian sociology professor stephen a kent published several articles where he relays practices of nrms with brainwashing the american psychological association apa in one nine eight four requested margaret singer the main proponent of anti cult mind control theories to set up a working group called task force on deceptive and indirect methods of persuasion and control dimpac in one nine eight seven the dimpac committee submitted its final report to the board of social and ethical responsibility for psychology of the apa on may one one one nine eight seven the board rejected the report in the rejection memo is stated finally after much consideration bserp does not believe that we have sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue there are two interpretations of this rejection one side e g amitrani and di marzio two zero zero zero and zablocki two zero zero one see it as no position on the issue of brainwashing the other e g introvigne one nine nine seven sees it as rejecting all brainwashing theories in two zero zero two dr philip zimbardo who teaches at stanford university a course the psychology of mind control commented on the request by former members of new religious movements nrms to reconsider the apa s position on the possibility of mind control recently there are indications that some members of both parties are willing to start a dialog e g the two zero zero one book misunderstanding cults searching for objectivity in a controversial field in two zero zero two the american family foundation invited eileen barker to its yearly conference and the evangelical ministries to new religions had j gordon melton and douglas cowan as conference speakers mind control and exit counseling opponents of some new religious movements accused so called cult s of coercing recruits to join and members to remain via strong influence acquired and maintained by manipulation see also anti cult movement and christian countercult movement many of these opponents advocate exit counseling as necessary to free the victim of a cult from mind control the practice of coercive deprogramming has practically ceased kent tyler hendricks former president of the unification church estimates approximately one zero zero zero zero zero people moved into the unification church as full time members from the one nine seven zero s to the one nine nine zero s membership in the church was eight six zero zero in two zero zero four counting only those who joined as adults and excluding the children of members this is an attrition rate of nine three billy graham one of the most successful evangelists of the last century had only an average of one of the attendants of his evangelizations heed the altar call at all follow up work after evangelizations shows that only one zero of the people responding to an altar call actually do join a church so successful christian evangelizations result in a longterm success rate of zero one compared to the four of barker s observation and these zero one do not become fulltime missionaries like in the unification church langone one nine nine three mind control and faith the american civil liberties union aclu published a statement in one nine seven seven related to brainwashing and mind control in this statement the aclu opposed certain methods depriving people of the free exercise of religion the aclu also rejected under certain conditions the idea that claims of the use of brainwashing or of mind control should overcome the free exercise of religion leon festinger based his theory of the cognitive dissonance a component of hassan s mind control model on his observation that the faith of most members of a ufo cult was unshattered by failed prophecy barrett who is affiliated with cesnur and eileen barker whom some anti cult activists consider cult apologists wrote that logical arguments are irrelevant when trying to persuade some members to leave a movement due to the certainty that they have about their faith which he sees as not confined to cults but also occurring in some forms of mainstream religion he also wrote that some members do not leave the movement even though they realize that things are wrong see also leaving a cult counter cult movement and mind control in the christian counter cult movement there are several voices explaining membership in christian and non christian cults exclusively with a theological regarding spiritual problems and therefore refuting mind control as a factor in cult membership in an article by the evangelical christian writers bob and gretchen passantino first appearing in cornerstone magazine titled overcoming the bondage of victimization a critical evaluation of cult mind control theories they challenge the validity of mind control theories and the alleged victimization by mind control and assert in their conclusion the bogey man of cult mind control is nothing but a ghost story good for inducing an adrenaline high and maintaining a crusade but irrelevant to reality the reality is that people who have very real spiritual emotional and social needs are looking for fulfillment and significance for their lives ill equipped to test the false gospels of this world they make poor decisions about their religious affiliations poor decisions yes but decisions for which they are personally responsible nonetheless as christians who believe in an absolute standard of truth and religious reality we cannot ignore the spiritual threat of the cults we must promote critical thinking responsible education biblical apologetics and christian evangelism we must recognize that those who join the cults while morally responsible are also spiritually ignorant in a rebuttal to the passantino s article a protagonist of the counter cult movement paul r martin ph d et al in his overcoming the bondage of revictimization a rational empirical defense of thought reform first appeared in cultic studies journal one five two one nine nine eight writes the passantinos are well known and respected evangelical writers consequently their critique which is rife with errors and misinterpretations disturbs us very much and calls for a detailed rebuttal for us theological considerations inform our understanding of the sociological and psychological destruction caused by cults although others hold similar positions without considering theological issues cults distort one s perceptions both of natural reality sociological and psychological and spiritual reality in the christian tradition the former is supposed to reveal the latter therefore those interested in spiritual issues must address both sides in order to minister adequately to former cult members legal issues some persons have claimed a brainwashing defense for crimes committed while purportedly under mind control in the cases of patty hearst steven fishman and lee boyd malvo the court rejected such defenses also in the court cases against members of aum shinrikyo regarding the one nine nine five sarin gas attack on the tokyo subway system the mind control defense was not a mitigating factor starting from the fishman case one nine nine zero where a defendant accused of commercial fraud raised as a defense that he was not fully responsible since he was under the mind control of scientology american courts consistently rejected testimonies about mind control and manipulation stating that these were not part of accepted mainline science according to the frye standard anthony during trial wollersheim s experts testified scientology s auditing and disconnect practices constituted brainwashing and thought reform akin to what the chinese and north koreans practiced on american prisoners of war a religious practice which takes place in the context of this level of coercion has less religious value than one the recipient engages in voluntarily even more significantly it poses a greater threat to society to have coerced religious practices inflicted on its citizens using its position as religious leader the church and its agents coerced wollersheim into continuing auditing even though his sanity was repeatedly threatened by this practice thus there is adequate proof the religious practice in this instance caused real harm to the individual and the appellant s outrageous conduct caused that harm church practices conducted in a coercive environment are not qualified to be voluntary religious practices entitled to first amendment religious freedom guarantees in one nine nine three the european court of human rights upheld the right of a greek jehovah s witness minos kokkinakis who had been sentenced to prison and a fine for proselytizing to spread his faith though the court sought to define what it regarded as acceptable ways of sharing one s faith however in a dissenting judgment two judges argued that kokkinakis and his wife had applied unacceptable psychological techniques akin to brainwashing kokkinakis v greece one four three zero seven eight eight one nine nine three echr two zero two five may one nine nine three mind control against children in parental alienation stanley clawar and brynne rivlin have claimed in children held hostage dealing with programmed and brainwashed children that many forms of mind control are used in parental alienation by one parent against the other parent using both parents children as unwitting weapons this use of mind control is often devastating to children and follows them into adulthood by creating a chronic condition known as parental alienation syndrome in addition the mind control used in parental alienation often permamently damages or destroys the target parent s bonds with his or her children mind control in conspiracy theory some discredit these views as possible symptoms of schizophrenia and sometimes of other forms of psychosis include the belief that one is subject to external mind control often by use of some form of technology were there any validity to the theories this would certainly generate fear in any parties who knew of such technology from speaking up principles behind such devices have been proposed because of study in the one nine three zero s of the neural cells of the giant squid which are similar to those of humans but much larger it is known that establishing a potential energy field across a neuron or neural cell membrane will cause it to fire seventy five years of understanding of this fact lends support that devices could have been devised to affect human mental and bodily function using external energy sources these often involve proposed mind control technologies such as the use of microwave radiation or lasers to control thoughts often by intelligence agencies and by secret societies mind control is a common feature in many conspiracy theories as it provides a mechanism by which an alleged conspiracy could maintain control over innocent people prevent knowledge of the conspiracy s actions and in some cases prevent the conspiracy theorist s intended audience from believing him of course naming a theory as a conspiracy theory does not disprove it political conspiracies have existed in the past and certainly will in the future the means by which victims are alleged to be controlled varies according to the nature of the theory theories centering on existing governmental groups usually feature mind control via subliminal messages or other technological means while theories focusing on non human entities extraterrestrials demons invisible masters and organised secret societies such as the freemasons black dragon society or the illuminati are more likely to involve supernatural or magical means or particularly fanciful technology such as mind control satellites theories that involve the united states government frequently refer to mkultra radio waves are frequently claimed to be used for mind control radio and television broadcast towers and more recently cell phone towers are often considered suspect j d salinger s novel the catcher in the rye was rumored to be a device for fbi cia mind control at one time based on the apparent coincidence of lee harvey oswald and mark chapman owning a copy seeing as this has always been a popular novel among intelligent and alienated young men however this coincidence of ownership is hardly surprising nevertheless there is a large fringe literature on the supposed mind control subtext of catcher in the rye mind control in fiction mind control has proven a popular subject in fiction featuring in books and films such as the ipcress file and the manchurian candidate which has the premise that controllers could hypnotize a person into murdering on command while retaining no memory of the killing the tv series the prisoner featured mind control as a recurring plot element in the anthony burgess novel a clockwork orange later adapted into a film by stanley kubrick the ludovico technique is a form of mind control that causes the subject in this case the thug anti hero alex to feel sickness and pain whenever he has a violent or anti social impulse george orwell s novel nineteen eighty four features a description of mind control both directly by torture and indirectly in the form of pervasive mind control by the use of newspeak a constructed language designed to remove the possibility sapir whorf wise of articulating or of even thinking subversive thoughts in science fiction fantasy and superhero fiction mind control often appears as the means whereby a person literally seizes control of the minds of the victims to the point where not only their bodies come under direct control but also their consciousnesses as well so that they become puppets or slaves to the controller fiction often depicts this process taking place electronically the trademark equipment of the batman supervillain the mad hatter headgear designed to put victims under his control when placed in direct physical contact with the head furnishes one example of this in addition characters with powerful telepathic or psychic abilities like professor x and jean grey of the x men can do the same with mental concentration against a target there has also been a rapidly growing genre known as erotic mind control where the controller s motivation is to control victims for the controller s own pleasure although this is often described as resulting in pleasure for the victims as well most such stories are published only online as they are written by amateur writers as a hobby the illuminatus trilogy pokes fun at conspiracy theorists assertions of pervasive mind control the best known example for the book is the fnord a word that the populace at large has been programmed since birth to not consciously notice but to associate with a sense of fear and general unease it is supposedly inserted into published works on current events such as magazines and newspapers but is absent from advertising leading people to avoid knowledge of the world and to be obedient consumers mind control is also frequently found as an ability in fantasy role playing games allowing a player or non player character to take control of another player or character for example in the mmorpg world of warcraft players of the priest class gain the ability to mind control other humanoid characters gaining full control over their actions for a short period due to interface limitations priests cannot do anything else while controlling a target likewise priest units in populous the beginning as well as age of empires are able to take control of an opponent s units in fact this is their primary function in both games in konami s stealhy title metal gear solid for the playsatation psycho mantis a rogue special foces member holds control over the entire genetically modified army it is also speculated that he may have had control over the other rogue members in the matrix a chemical was injected into morpheus to make him reveal access codes the priest

is impossible to have a complete understanding of the more than one five zero individually funded research projects sponsored by mkultra and the related cia programs the term mind control evolved from theories of brainwashing after these theories had been found not applicable and discredited with regard to cults note that sociologists and other experts often dispute about what constitutes a cult some theorists maintain that merely by milieu control or censoring all information that might dissuade belief a group of manipulators may take control of the mind of a person who is otherwise free to end his association with the group see especially steve hassan and flo conway in the anti cult movement and christian countercult movement mind control has the meaning of strong influence acquired and maintained by manipulation the molotov ribbentrop pact also known as the hitler stalin pact or ribbentrop molotov pact or nazi soviet pact and formally known as the treaty of nonaggression between germany and the union of soviet socialist republics was a non aggression treaty between the german third reich and the soviet union it was signed in moscow on august two three one nine three nine by the soviet foreign minister vyacheslav molotov and the german foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop the mutual non aggression treaty lasted until operation barbarossa of june two two one nine four one when nazi germany invaded the soviet union although officially labelled a non aggression treaty the pact included a secret protocol in which the independent countries of finland estonia latvia lithuania poland and romania were divided into spheres of interest of the parties the secret protocol explicitly assumed territorial and political rearrangements in the areas of these countries which practically rendered it into an aggressive military alliance in spite of its official name subsequently all the mentioned countries were invaded by either the soviets the nazis or both only finland which fought twice against the soviet union in wwii successfully resisted conquest but was forced to concede territory background in one nine one eight by the treaty of brest litovsk the new bolshevik russian state accepted the loss of sovereignty and influence over finland estonia latvia lithuania poland belarus and ukraine plus parts of armenia and georgia as a concession to the central powers in accordance with the mitteleuropa policy they were designated to become satellite states to or parts of the german empire with dukes and kings related to the german emperor as a consequence of the german defeat in the autumn of one nine one eight and not without active support from the allied victors of the world war most of them became democratic republics but also proxies for france and britain against the bolsheviks in the russian civil war with the exception of belarus and ukraine all of these countries also became independent and fully sovereign however in many cases independence was followed by civil wars related to the russian revolution in the one nine two zero s fear of russia and of communism motivated attempts to foster political cooperation and defense treaties between these so called border states molotov signs the german soviet non aggression pact behind him are ribbentrop and stalin the european balance of power established at the end of world war i was eroded step by step from the abyssinia crisis one nine three five to the munich agreement one nine three eight the dissolution of czechoslovakia signaled increasing instability as nazi germany the soviet union and other countries such as hungary and bulgaria aspired to regain territories lost in the aftermath of world war i the western democracies britain and france notional guarantors of the territorial status quo stood by until the march one nine three nine destruction of czechoslovakia maintaining a policy of non intervention while the fascist governments of germany and italy supported the victorious right wing rebels in their destruction of the democratic spanish republic in the spanish civil war of one nine three six three nine for the soviet union the molotov ribbentrop pact was a much needed response to the deterioration of the european security situation in the latter half of the one nine three zero s as nazi germany aligned with fascist italy in the axis powers aimed to reverse the disadvantageous treaty of versailles after world war i in addition the ongoing soviet japanese border war of one nine three nine culminating in the battle of halhin gol may have been a significant consideration for the soviets for whom a two front war was an anathema the pact may in fact have influenced the japanese to seek a cease fire two weeks after the pact s announcement for its part the soviet union was not interested in maintaining a status quo which it saw as disadvantageous to its interests deriving as it did from the period of soviet weakness immediately following the one nine one seven october revolution and russian civil war soviet leaders adopted the position that conflict between what they characterized as rival imperialist countries was not only an inevitable consequence of capitalism but would also enhance conditions for the spread of communism this strategy worked out well for the victorious soviets who spread communism into eastern europe after the countries were weakened during world war ii during one nine three eight the soviet union as well as france offered to abide by their defensive military alliance with czechoslovakia in the event of german invasion but the czechoslovakian agrarian party was so strongly opposed to soviet troops entering the country that they threatened a civil war might result if they did the one nine three five agreement between the soviet union czechoslovakia and france stipulated that soviet aid could only come to czechoslovakia if france came to their aid as well the reluctance of the western democracies to form an anti fascist alliance with the ussr and france and britain s pact with hitler signed at munich was indicative of a lack of interest from the side of the west to oppose the growing fascist movement already exemplified by the events of the spanish civil war the soviets were not invited to the munich conference of september one nine three eight when the french and british prime ministers daladier and chamberlain agreed to the dismemberment of czechoslovakia as the french had not honoured their one nine two four treaty with the czechs the soviets concluded that their one nine three five alliance with france was valueless and that the west was trying to divert germany to the east in march one nine three nine hitler s denunciation of the one nine three four german polish non aggression pact was taken by the soviets as a clear signal of hitler s aggressive intentions litvinov in april outlined a french british soviet alliance with military commitment against fascist powers but chamberlain s government procrastinated partly because the soviets demanded too much a guarantee to the baltic states complete reciprocity and the right to send troops through poland however chamberlain who already on two four march had with france guaranteed the sovereignty of poland now on two five april signed a pact of mutual assistance with poland consequently stalin no longer feared that the west would leave the soviet union to fight hitler alone indeed if germany and the west went to war as seemed likely the ussr could afford to remain neutral and wait for them to destroy each other franco british negotiations with the soviet union negotiations between the soviet union france and britain for a military alliance against germany stalled mainly due to mutual suspicions the soviet union sought guarantees for support against german aggression and recognition of the right of the soviet union to interfere against a change of policy favorable to an aggressor in the countries along the western soviet border although none of the affected countries had formally asked for protection by the soviet union it nevertheless announced guarantees for the independence of finland estonia latvia poland romania turkey and greece the so called sanitary cordon erected between nazi germany and the soviet union the british and french feared that this would allow soviet intervention in neighboring countries internal affairs even in the absence of an immediate external german threat however with the third reich now demanding territorial concessions from poland in the face of polish opposition the threat of war was increasing but although telegrams were exchanged between the western powers and the soviet union as early as april one nine three nine the military missions sent by the western powers with a slow transport vessel did not arrive in moscow until august one one and were given no authority to sign a treaty the fundamental sticking point was the question of poland lying between germany and the soviet union the polish government rightly feared that the soviet government sought to annex the disputed territories of kresy incorporated in poland in one nine two zero after the polish soviet war characterized by the kremlin as irredenta western ukraine and western belarus since parts of them were inhabited by ethnically ukrainian and belarusian majorities respectively and the majority of the population of then western poland was non polish therefore the polish government refused to allow the soviet military to enter its territory and establish military bases in preparation for the now inevitable war with germany a situation that allegedly left the red army without any possibility of confronting the germans before poland was invaded three weeks into august the negotiations ground to a halt with each side doubting the other s motives and the kremlin suspecting that they were being led into a conflict limited to the ussr and germany the munich agreement and soviet foreign policy defenders of the soviet position argue that the soviet union entered the non aggression pact after the september one nine three eight munich agreement had made it evident that the western countries were pursuing a policy of appeasement and were not interested in joining the soviet union in an anti fascist alliance promoted through their popular front tactic in addition there was concern about the possibility that france and britain would stay neutral in a war initiated by germany hoping that the warring states would wear each other out and put an end to both the soviet union and the nazis biographers of stalin point out that he believed the british rejected his proposal of an anti fascist alliance because they were plotting with nazi germany against the soviet union and that the western democracies were expecting the third reich to attack communist russia and were hoping that the nazi forces would wipe out the soviet union or that both countries would fight each other to the point of exhaustion and then collapse these suspicions were reinforced when chamberlain and hitler met for the munich agreement the defenders of the soviet position also argue it was necessary to enter into a non aggression pact to buy time since the soviet union was not in a position to fight a war in one nine three nine and needed at least three years to prepare this argument matches the views of stalin s critics who maintain that one reason why the soviet union was not in a position to fight a war was stalin s great purge of one nine three six to one nine three eight which among other things eliminated much of the military s most experienced leadership a well known fact is that when german forces finally did attack the soviet union on june two two one nine four one the red army was completely unprepared for the assault despite multiple advanced warnings from foreign as well as from soviet intelligence critics of stalin question his determination to oppose germany s growing military aggressiveness since the soviet union began commercial and military cooperation with germany in one nine three six and grew these relationships until the german invasion began after the british and french declaration of war on germany these economic relationships allowed germany to circumvent the allied naval blockade thus allowing it to avoid the disastrous situtation it faced in ww one nazi soviet rapprochement the prussian tribute in moscow satirical newspaper mucha september eight one nine three nine warsaw on three may one nine three nine the soviet secretary general joseph stalin replaced maxim litvinov a jew by nationality with molotov as foreign minister thereby opening for negotiations with nazi germany litvinov had been associated with the previous policy of creating an anti fascist coalition and was considered pro western by the standards of the kremlin molotov let it be known that he would welcome a peaceful settlement of issues with germany according to paul flewers stalin s address to the eighteenth congress of the communist party of the soviet union on one zero march one nine three nine discounted any idea of german designs on the soviet union stalin had intended to be cautious and not allow our country to be drawn into conflicts by warmongers who are accustomed to have others pull the chestnuts out of the fire for them this was intended to warn the western democratic powers that they could not necessarily rely upon the support of the soviet union as mr flewers put it stalin was publicly making the none too subtle implication that some form of deal between the soviet union and germany could not be ruled out during the last two weeks of august one nine three nine the soviet japanese border war reached its peak at hitler s suggestion the german foreign minister ribbentrop visited moscow on one nine august one nine three nine a seven year german soviet trade agreement establishing economic ties between the two states was signed for a german credit to the soviet union of two zero zero million marks in exchange for raw materials petrol grain cotton phosphates and timber molotov then proposed an additional protocol covering the points in which the high contracting parties are interested in the field of foreign policy this was thought by some to have been precipitated by the alleged stalin s speech on august one nine one nine three nine where he supposedly asserted that a great war between the western powers was necessary for the spread of world revolution on august two two moscow revealed that ribbentrop will be visiting stalin the next day this happened while russians still pretended negotiating a military pact with the british and french missions in moscow instead a secret nazi soviet alliance emerged on august two four a one zero year non aggression pact was signed with provisions that included consultation arbitration if either party disagreed neutrality if either went to war against a third power no membership of a group which is directly or indirectly aimed at the other however there was also a secret protocol to the pact revealed only on germany s defeat in one nine four five according to which the states of northern and eastern europe were divided into german and soviet spheres of influence in the north finland estonia and latvia were apportioned to the soviet sphere poland was to be partitioned in the event of its political rearrangement the areas east of the rivers narev vistula and san going to the soviet union while the germans would occupy the west lithuania adjacent to east prussia would be in the german sphere of influence in the south the soviet union s interest and german lack of interest in bessarabia a part of romania were acknowledged the german diplomat hans von herwarth informed his u s colleague charles bohlen on the secret protocol on august two four but the information stopped at the desk of president franklin roosevelt planned and actual territorial changes in central europe one nine three nine one nine four zero concerns over the possible existence of a secret appendix were first expressed in the intelligence organizations of the baltic states scant days after the pact was signed and the speculations grew stronger when soviet negotiators referred to its content during negotiations for military bases in those countries the german original was presumably destroyed in the bombings but its microfilmed copy was included in the documents archive of the german foreign office karl von loesch a civil servant in foreign office gave this copy to british lt col r c thomson in may one nine four five the soviet union denied the existence of the secret protocols until one nine eight eight when politburo member alexander nikolaevich yakovlev admitted the existence of the protocols although the document itself was declassified only after the dissolution of the soviet union in one nine nine two stalin who had feared that the west was encouraging hitler to fight the east must have been aware that the secret clause was likely to unleash war because it freed hitler from the prospect of a war against the ussr while fighting france and britain the pact started to deteriorate in april one nine four zero when germany invaded denmark and norway and in june one nine four zero when the soviet union annexed not only bessarabia but also bukovina from romania both nations were clearly overstepping their defined spheres of influence as agreed to in the pact however in one nine four seven stalin said that he would have continued to work with germany had hitler been willing certainly stalin had more to gain from cooperation with germany e g poland than from cooperation with britain according to historian e h carr stalin was convinced that no german would be so foolish as to engage in hostilities on two fronts stalin therefore considered it axiomatic that if germany was at war with the west then it would have to be friendly with the soviet union soviet propanganda as well as its representatives went to great lengths to minimize the importance of the fact that they had opposed and fought against the nazis in various ways for a decade prior to signing the pact however they never went as far as to take a pro german stance officially the molotov ribbentrop pact was worded as a non aggression treaty not a pact of alliance still it is said that upon signing the pact molotov tried to reassure the germans of his good intentions by commenting to journalists that fascism is a matter of taste the extent to which the soviet union s earlier territorial acquisitions may have contributed to preventing its fall and thus a nazi victory in the war remains a factor in evaluating the pact soviet sources pointed out that the german advance eventually stopped just a few kilometers away from moscow so the role of the extra territory might have been crucial in such a close call others say that poland and the baltic countries played the important role of buffer states between the soviet union and nazi germany and that the molotov ribbentrop pact was a precondition not only for germany s invasion of western europe but also for the third reich s invasion of the soviet union the military aspect of moving from established fortified positions on the stalin line into undefended polish territory could also be seen as one of the causes of rapid dissolution of soviet armed forces in one nine four one as the newly built molotov line was unfinished and unable to provide soviet troops with necessary defences effects soviet and german soldiers meeting after the invasion of poland the stab in the back dziennik chicagowski chicago daily the polish daily news september one nine one nine three nine on september one barely a week after the pact had been signed the partition of poland commenced with the german invasion the soviet union invaded from the east on september one seven practically concluding a fourth partition of poland and violating the soviet polish non aggression pact signed in one nine three two the pact caused great shock in the western world among governments which had most feared such an outcome and even more so among the communists themselves many of whom found these soviet dealings with their nazi enemy incomprehensible a famous cartoon by david low from the london evening standard of two zero september one nine three nine has hitler and stalin bowing to each other over the corpse of poland with hitler saying the scum of the earth i believe and stalin replying the bloody assassin of the workers i presume at brest litovsk soviet and german commanders held a joint victory parade before german forces withdrew westward behind a new demarcation line and on september two eight one nine three nine soviet union and german reich issued joint declaration in which they declared that they mutually express their conviction that it would serve the true interest of all peoples to put an end to the state of war existing at present between germany on the one side and england and france on the other both governments will therefore direct their common efforts jointly with other friendly powers if occasion arises toward attaining this goal as soon as possible should however the efforts of the two governments remain fruitless this would demonstrate the fact that england and france are responsible for the continuation of the war whereupon in case of the continuation of the war the governments of germany and of the u s s r shall engage in mutual consultations with regard to necessary measures the soviets take over in brest litovsk the german general at the center is heinz guderian on september two eight th one nine three nine the three baltic states were given no choice but to sign a so called pact of defence and mutual assistance which permitted the soviet union to station troops in estonia latvia and lithuania the same day a supplementary german soviet protocol had transferred most of lithuania from the envisaged german sphere to the soviet sphere of interest finland resisted similar claims and was attacked by the soviet union on november three zero after more than three months of heavy fighting and losses in the ensuing winter war the soviet union gave up its intended occupation of finland in exchange for approximately one zero of finland s territory most of which was still held by the finnish army on june one five one seven one nine four zero after the wehrmacht s swift occupation of norway denmark the netherlands belgium and the defeat of france it was time for the three baltic states to be occupied and soon annexed by the soviet union finally on june two six four days after france accepted its defeat by the third reich the soviet union requested in an ultimatum bessarabia bukovina and the hertza region from romania alerted about this soviet move ribbentrop had stressed on june two five in his reply to the soviet leaders the strong german economic interests oil industry and agriculture being paramount in romania this ensured that romanian territory wouldn t be transformed into a battlefield additionally ribbentrop claimed that this german interest also arose from concern over the faith and future of one zero zero zero zero zero ethnic germans of bessarabia in september almost all ethnic germans of bessarabia were resettled in germany as part of the nazi soviet population transfers german and soviet soldiers at the so called border of peace established by the pact with france no longer in a position to be the guarantor of the status quo in eastern europe and the third reich pushing romania to make concessions to the soviet union the romanian government gave in following italy s counsel and vichy france s recent example in the month of august one nine four zero the fear of the soviet union in conjunction with german support for the territorial demands of romania s neighbors and the romanian government s own miscalculations resulted in more territorial losses for romania the second vienna award orchestrated mainly by ribbentrop created a competition between romania and hungary for germany s favour concerning transylvania in the end the territory ceded to hungary also had a large jewish community which suffered deportation by the hungarian government to germany in one nine four four by september one nine four zero romania s economic and military resources were fully dedicated to german interests in the east aftermath hitler tearing the nonagression pact a one nine four one poster by kukryniksy artists the soviet occupied territories were organized into republics of the soviet union the local population was purged of anti soviet or potentially anti soviet elements and new border regions were ethnically cleansed tens of thousands of people in these territories were executed and hundreds of thousands were deported to far asian regions and to gulag concentration work camps where many perished later these occupied territories were in the front line of the war and also suffered from the nazi terror behind the wwii eastern front by early one nine four one the german and soviet occupation zones shared a border running through what is now lithuania and poland nazi soviet relations began to cool again and the signs of a clash between the wehrmacht and the red army began to show in german propaganda a clash that was not without appeal to the populations in occupied western europe where the anti bolshevism from the times of the russian civil war twenty years before had not quite faded by appearing as the unifying leader of the west against the east hitler hoped for boosted popularity at home and abroad and an impetus for peace with britain meanwhile the soviet union was supporting germany in the war effort against western europe through the german soviet commercial agreement with supplies of raw materials phosphates chrome and iron ore mineral oil grain cotton rubber these and other supplies were being transported through soviet and occupied polish territories and allowed germany to circumvent the british naval blockade the third reich ended the molotov ribbentrop pact of august one nine three nine by invading the soviet union in operation barbarossa on june two two one nine four one together with romania and thus closing the western front and opening an eastern front that would ultimately lead to the defeat of germany after the launch of the german invasion the territories gained by the soviet union due to the molotov ribbentrop pact were lost in a matter of weeks and for example the baltic countries ended up as german protectorates the german attack was followed by a soviet pre emptive attack on finland on june two five starting the continuation war between finland and the soviet union alternative terms the most established term for the treaty is the molotov ribbentrop pact this term is for example used on more web pages than any other name however in the english speaking world the term nazi soviet pact has always been popular and has seemingly gained increasing popularity over time this term is particularly widely used in journalism and school books on history however in some contexts the term hitler stalin pact is more common and sometimes dominant translations from german and dutch some textbooks on history in works aiming at a less condemning or more neutral view of russia and the post stalinist soviet union a usage sometimes denounced by critics as propagandist the term stalin hitler pact can likewise be found in works by authors whose views were colored by anti communism and the cold war see also baltic republics katyn massacre

was taken two days after his april two one two zero zero four release from prison born october one three one nine five four also known by his baptismal name john crossman is an israeli former nuclear technician who revealed details of israel s nuclear weapons program to the british press in one nine eight six he was subsequently lured to rome by an israeli mossad agent abducted and smuggled to israel where he was tried behind closed doors and convicted of treason after one eight years in prison more than one one years of which were served in solitary confinement vanunu was released from prison in two zero zero four subject to a broad array of restrictions on his speech and movement since then he has been briefly arrested several times for multiple violations of those restrictions including giving various interviews to foreign journalists and attempting to leave israel in march two zero zero five he was charged with two one counts of contravening a lawful direction with a maximum of two years imprisonment per count and then released to await trial though he remains under the same restrictions as before vanunu was seen by some human rights groups as a prisoner of conscience in their press release of two zero zero five zero four one nine amnesty international said if mordechai vanunu were to be imprisoned for breaching the restrictions imposed on him amnesty international would consider him to be a prisoner of conscience the israeli government still considers him a traitor and vanunu continues to be highly critical of israel s actions even rejecting the need for a jewish state background vanunu was born in marrakech morocco to a jewish family his father was a rabbi he emigrated under the law of return with his parents and his one one brothers and sisters to israel in one nine six three vanunu completed his three years of military service in the sapper unit of the israeli defense forces with the rank of sergeant after being honorably discharged vanunu became a philosophy student at ben gurion university of the negev where he became critical of many policies of the israeli government forming a group called campus with four other jewish students and five arab students vanunu also admired his professor evron pollakov a left wing politics wing professor at ben gurion university who had refused to serve with the idf in lebanon and had been jailed because of it vanunu also was affiliated with a group called movement for the advancement of peace between one nine seven six and one nine eight five vanunu was employed as a nuclear technician at the negev nuclear research center an israeli facility which according to the majority of defense experts is used for manufacturing nuclear weapons it is located in the negev desert south of dimona most worldwide intelligence agencies estimate that israel developed nuclear weapons as early as the one nine six zero s but the country has purposely maintained a policy of deliberate ambiguity neither acknowledging nor denying that it possesses the weapons it was during his employment there that one of the left wing groups in which vanunu held membership protested against israel s one nine eight one destruction of iraq s osiraq nuclear reactor which was believed to be part of the iraqi nuclear weapons development program the jerusalem post stated that he took part in these protests arguing that this showed that vanunu was motivated by antipathy to israel in his later actions vanunu has not responded to these claims at dimona it is believed that vanunu became increasingly troubled about the widely believed israeli nuclear weapons program on which he worked in one nine eight five he was laid off from dimona and left israel he arrived at nepal and considered a conversion to buddhism later traveling to burma and thailand in one nine eight six he traveled to sydney australia while there vanunu lived in a hostel in kings cross and worked in odd jobs first as a hotel dishwasher and later as a taxi driver vanunu began to attend the local church st john s there he met the reverend john mcknight who worked with the homeless and drug addicts vanunu converted to christianity and was baptized as john crossman into the anglican church this estranged him from his family while in sydney he met peter hounam a journalist from the sunday times in london disclosure abduction and publication on october five one nine eight six the british newspaper the sunday times ran the story on its front page under the headline revealed the secrets of israel s nuclear arsenal in early september one nine eight six vanunu flew to london with hounam and in violation of his non disclosure agreement revealed to the sunday times his knowledge of the israeli nuclear program including photographs he had secretly taken at the dimona site anxious to avoid being duped by another hitler diaries sized hoax the sunday times spent extensive time verifying vanunu s story with leading experts apparently frustrated by the delay while hounam was completing his research vanunu approached a rival newspaper the tabloid sunday mirror whose owner was robert maxwell in one nine nine one a self described former mossad officer called ari ben menashe alleged that maxwell had tipped off the mossad about vanunu it is also possible that they were alerted by enquiries made to the israeli embassy in london by sunday mirror journalists the israeli government had a good relationship with prime minister margaret thatcher so to avoid embarrassment it was important to get vanunu out of uk territory under his own volition the territorial integrity of italy did not receive the same respect on september three zero an israeli mossad agent cheryl bentov operating under the name of cindy and masquerading as an american tourist began an affair with vanunu eventually persuading him to fly to rome with her on a holiday once in rome mossad agents drugged him and smuggled him to israel on a freighter beginning what was to be more than a decade of solitary confinement in israeli prisons on october five the sunday times published the information he had revealed and estimated that israel had produced more than one zero zero nuclear warheads imprisonment vanunu was put on trial in israel on charges of treason and espionage the trial held in camera took place at the district court in jerusalem before chief justice eliahu noam and judges zvi tal and shalom brener he was not permitted contact with the media but he wrote the details of his capture or hijacking as he put it on the palm of his hand and while being transported he held his hand against the van s window so that waiting journalists could get the information see this act caused israel s standard procedures for transporting prisoners to be changed on february two seven one nine eight eight the court sentenced him to one eight years imprisonment from the date of his capture the israeli government refused to release the transcript of the court case until after the threat of legal action it agreed to let censored extracts be published in yedioth ahronoth an israeli newspaper in late one nine nine nine the death penalty in israel is restricted to special circumstances in two zero zero four former mossad director shabtai shavit told reuters that the option of extrajudicial execution was considered in one nine eight six but rejected because jews don t do that to other jews see the israeli government kept him in near total isolation for more than one one years allegedly out of concern that he might reveal more israeli nuclear secrets and because he was still bound by the contract that swore him to secrecy on the subject however many critics argue that vanunu had no additional information that would pose a real security threat to israel and that the israeli government s real motivation is a desire to avoid political embarrassment for itself and allies such as the united states dr ray kidder a senior american nuclear scientist at lawrence livermore national laboratory has said on the basis of this research and my own professional experience i am ready to challenge any official assertion that mr vanunu possesses any technical nuclear information not already made public his last appeal against his conviction to the supreme court of israel in one nine nine zero failed while in prison vanunu says he took part in small acts of rebellion such as refusing to talk with the guards reading only english language newspapers and watching only bbc tv he even refused to eat food when it was served to him so as to maintain a small portion of his life not under israeli control he is the most stubborn principled and tough person i have ever met said his lawyer avigdor feldman release in two zero zero four shortly before his scheduled release vanunu remained defiant under interrogation by the security service shin bet in recordings of the interview made public after his release he is heard saying i am neither a traitor nor a spy i only wanted the world to know what was happening he also said we don t need a jewish state there needs to be a palestinian state jews can and have lived anywhere so a jewish state is not necessary vanunu was released from prison on april two one two zero zero four he indicated a desire to completely dissociate himself from israel refusing to speak in hebrew and planning to move to scandinavia ireland or france as soon as the israeli government would permit him to do so a number of restrictions were placed upon vanunu by israeli authorities who stated their reason was fear of him spreading further state secrets and that he is still bound by his non disclosure agreement these stipulate that he has to register to live in an israeli city of his choice has to give notice to the authorities if he wishes to travel to another city is not allowed to leave israel for six months this restriction has since been extended to april two zero zero six is not allowed to contact foreigners either by phone or in person is not allowed to enter any embassy visit any port of entry or come within five zero zero metres of any international border crossing vanunu says that his knowledge is now all outdated and that he has nothing more he could possibly reveal that is not already widely known despite the stated restrictions since his release vanunu has freely given interviews to the foreign press including a live phone interview to bbc radio scotland on april two two two zero zero four vanunu asked the norwegian government for a norwegian passport and asylum in norway for humanitarian reasons according to norwegian news agencies he also sent applications to other countries and stated that he would accept asylum in any country because he fears for his life former conservative norwegian prime minister k re willoch has asked the conservative government to give vanunu asylum and the university of troms has offered him a job this application as well as an application for asylum in sweden has been rejected since neither country accepts absentee asylum applications two zero zero four arrests on thursday november one one two zero zero four

louisiana the spanish captured the port town in one seven eight zero during the american revolutionary war the spanish held mobile until one eight one three when it was captured by the american general wilkinson by then it was the second largest seaport on the gulf coast the cotton boom of the early one nine th century brought an explosion of commerce to what had been a sleepy frontier town by the one eight five zero s mobile was one of the four busiest ports in the united states the wealth created by this trade brought the city to a cultural high point mobile became well known throughout the country and the world in another note of differentiation between the somewhat cosmopolitan port and the hinterlands of predominantly protestant alabama mobile was declared an

substantially in the period leading up to the american civil war when the confederates heavily fortified it union naval forces established a blockade under the command of admiral david farragut the

field later brookley air force base brookley quickly became the areas largest employer in the mid one nine six zero s the air force base was closed due to a department of defence base realignment and the airport returned to the city today it is known as mobile downtown airport during the war the phenomenal influx of workers created a huge housing shortage citizens rented out extra rooms and also converted porches garages and even chicken coops into rentals several federal housing projects were quickly built to house the new maritime and air force workers several of these are still to be found notably the community of birdville by one nine five six mobile s square mileage had tripled to accommodate the growth brookley s closure in the mid one nine six zero s sent economic tremors through the area which took many years to absorb also in the post war period the pulp and paper industry became a major industry in mobile scott paper company and international paper combined to have one the

important in the catabolism of monoamines ingested in food both maos are also vital to the inactivation of monoaminergic neurotransmitters for which they display different specificities thus serotonin is mainly broken down by mao a as is norepinephrine noradrenaline and epinephrine adrenaline while phenethylamine is broken down by mao b both forms break down dopamine genetics the genes encoding mao a and mao b are both located on the short arm of the x chromosome these two genes are to be found side by side and have about seven zero homology disorders resulting from mao dysfunction because of the vital role that maos play in the inactivation of neurotransmitters mao dysfunction too much too little mao activity is thought to be responsible for a number of neurological disorders for example unusually high or low levels of maos in the body have been associated with depression substance abuse criminality attention deficit disorder and social phobias monoamine oxidase inhibitors are one of

the king s unlimited power the failures of king john were threefold first there was a general lack of respect for king john because of the way he took power there were two candidates to take the place of the previous king richard the lionheart when he died in one one nine nine john and his nephew arthur of brittany in normandy john captured arthur and imprisoned him and he was never heard from again although arthur s murder was never proven it was assumed and many saw it as a black mark against john that he would murder his own family to be king secondly after philip augustus the king of france seized most of the english holdings in france the english barons demanded of their king that he retake the land and while he attempted to do so eight years later the effort came to failure at the battle of bouvines in one two one four john was given the nickname of lackland not because of this loss but because he had received no land rights in the continental provinces unlike his elder brothers in french he is known as jean sans terre john without land the third failure of john was when he became embroiled in a dispute with the church over the appointment of the office of archbishop of canterbury john wanted to appoint his own archbishop and the church wanted to appoint stephen langton this struggle went on for several years during which england was placed under a sentence of interdict and finally john was forced to submit to the will of the church in one two one three runnymede and afterwards by one two one five the barons of england had had enough they banded together and took london by force on june one zero one two one five they forced king john to agree to a document known as the articles of the barons to which his great seal was attached in the meadow at runnymede on june one five one two one five in return the barons renewed their oaths of fealty to king john on june one nine one two one five a formal document to record the agreement between king john and the barons was created by the royal chancery on july one five this was the original magna carta an unknown number of copies of this document were sent out to officials such as royal sheriffs and bishops the most significant clause for king john at the time was clause six one known as the security clause the longest portion of the entire document this established a committee of two five barons who could at any time meet and over rule the will of the king through force by seizing his castles and possessions if needed this was based on a medieval legal practice known as distraint which was commonly done but it was the first time it had been applied to a monarch in addition the king was to take an oath of loyalty to the committee king john had no intention of honouring magna carta as it was sealed under extortion by force and clause six one essentially neutered his powers as a monarch making him king in name only he renounced it as soon as the barons left london plunging england into a civil war known as the first barons war pope innocent iii also immediately annulled the shameful and demeaning agreement forced upon the king by violence and fear the pope rejected any call for rights saying it impaired king john s dignity john died in the middle of the civil war of dysentery on october one eight one two one six and it quickly changed the nature of the war his nine year old son king henry iii was next in line for the throne the royalists believed the rebel barons would find the idea of loyalty to the child henry more palatable and so the child was swiftly crowned in late october one two one six and the war ended on november one two one two one six magna carta was reissued in henry s name by his regents with some of the clauses including the contentious clause six one omitted magna carta was again reissued by henry s regents in one two one seven when he turned eighteen in one two two five henry iii himself reissued magna carta a third time this time in a shorter version with only three seven articles henry iii ruled for five six years the longest reign of an english monarch in the medieval period so that by the time of henry s death in one two seven two magna carta had become a settled part of english legal precedent and more difficult for a future monarch to annul as king john had attempted nearly three generations earlier henry iii s son and heir edward i s parliament reissued magna carta for the final time on one two october one two nine seven as part of a statute known as confirmatio cartarum two five edw i reconfirming henry iii s shorter version of magna carta from one two two five magna carta of one two one five one of the certified copies of magna carta made in one two one five magna carta guaranteed certain english political liberties and contained clauses providing for a church free from domination by the monarchy reforming law and justice and controlling the behaviour of royal officials a large part of magna carta was copied nearly word for word from the charter of liberties of henry i issued when henry i ascended to the throne in one one zero zero which bound the king to certain laws regarding the treatment of church officials and nobles effectively granting certain civil liberties to the church and the english nobility magna carta is composed of six three different clauses or articles the majority of which are very specific to the one three th century and of temporary importance for example it repealed certain royal taxes that were unpopular and reduced the amount of hunting land that was royal and thus off limits to most nobles the text displays its origin as a product of negotiation haste and many hands one of the most important clauses that would have the longest lasting effect was article three nine according to which no free man shall be arrested or imprisoned or deprived of his property or outlawed or exiled or in any way destroyed nor shall we go against him or send against him unless by legal judgement of his peers or by the law of the land this meant the king must judge individuals according to the law and not according to his own will similarly article four zero stated to no one will we sell to no one will we refuse or delay right or justice these clauses were a check on the power of the king and the first step in the long road to a constitutional monarchy significance although the first version of magna carta remained in effect only a few weeks its reissue following john s death in autumn one two one six and the definite reissue of one two two five made it perpetual the first of england s statutes and a cornerstone of the british constitution henry iii and his successors evaded and broke provisions in the charters indeed the absolute power of the english monarchy despite magna carta actually grew during the medi val period for example in his historical play king john william shakespeare did not mention magna carta however a fundamental principle had been asserted and accepted by the king monarchy was subject to the law and the thirty reissues of magna carta during the medi val era reminded him of this fact even if he didn t always abide by it magna carta was not considered a particularly important document during the medi val period during which the power of the english crown grew the charter became increasingly important in the one seven th century as the conflict between the crown and parliament grew magna carta was repeatedly revised and other documents created such as the provisions of oxford guaranteeing greater rights to greater numbers of people thus setting the stage for the british constitutional monarchy the version of magna carta from one two nine seven is still part of english law although only part of the introductory sentences three articles and the ending remain in force the remaining three four articles have been repealed or superseded the articles currently in force are articles one nine and twenty nine of the one two nine seven version which are broadly similar to articles one thirteen thirty nine and forty of the one two one five version today magna carta has little practical legal use despite this it is still used in arguments about reform of the jury system many later attempts to draft constitutional forms of government including the united states constitution trace their lineage back to this source document the influence of magna carta can be clearly seen in the u s bill of rights which enumerates various rights of the people and restrictions on government power such as no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law article two one from the declaration of rights in the maryland constitution of one seven seven six reads that no freeman ought to be taken or imprisoned or disseized of his freehold liberties or privileges or outlawed or exiled or in any manner destroyed or deprived of his life liberty or property but by the judgment of his peers or by the law of the land magna carta has influenced international law as well eleanor roosevelt referred to the universal declaration of human rights as a magna carta for all mankind magna carta and the jews in england magna carta contained two articles related to money lending and jews in england jewish involvement with money lending caused christian resentment because the church forbade the lending of money at interest known at the time as usury it was seen as vice such as gambling an un christian way to profit at others expense and was punishable by excommunication although jews as non christians could not be excommunicated and were thus in a legal grey area secular leaders unlike the church tolerated the practice of jewish usury because it gave the leaders opportunity for personal enrichment this resulted in a complicated legal situation debtors were frequently trying to bring their jewish creditors before church courts where debts would be absolved as illegal while the jews were trying to get their debtors tried in secular courts where they would be able to collect plus interest the relations between the debtors and creditors would often become very nasty there were many attempts over centuries to resolve this problem and magna carta contains one example of the legal code of the time on this issue if one who has borrowed from the jews any sum great or small die before that loan be repaid the debt shall not bear interest while the heir is under age of whomsoever he may hold and if the debt fall into our hands we will not take anything except the principal sum contained in the bond and if anyone die indebted to the jews his wife shall have her dower and pay nothing of that debt and if any children of the deceased are left under age necessaries shall be provided for them in keeping with the holding of the deceased and out of the residue the debt shall be paid reserving however service due to feudal lords in like manner let it be done touching debts due to others than jews after the pope annulled magna carta future versions contained no mention of jews jews were seen by the church as a threat to their authority and the welfare of christians because of their special relationship to kings as moneylenders jews are the sponges of kings wrote the theologian william de montibus they are bloodsuckers of christian purses by whose robbery kings dispoil and deprive poor men of their goods thus the anti semitic wording as seen in magna carta originated in part because of christian nobles who permitted the otherwise illegal activity of usury a symptom of the larger ongoing power struggle between church and state during the middle ages copies several copies were made each time it was issued so all of the participants would each have one several of those still exist and some are on permanent display the original version of magna carta sealed by king john in one two one five has not survived four contemporaneous copies known as exemplifications remain all of which are located in the uk two held by the british library one at lincoln castle and one at salisbury cathedral thirteen other versions of magna carta dating to one two nine seven or earlier survive

administration in washington d c usage and spelling since there is no direct consistent correlate of the english definite article in latin the usual academic convention is to refer to the document in

constitution english laws in physics the modified newtonian dynamics mond is a burgeoning theory that attempts to explain the galaxy rotation problem by modifying newton s second law of motion the most widely accepted approach to explaining this problem postulates the existence of dark matter mond was proposed in one nine eight three by mordehai milgrom the central pillar of mond is the assumption that newton s second law f ma is a high acceleration approximation of a more accurate law that describes all accelerations the proposed modification would only become relevant when the total acceleration of a body falls significantly below the constant a zero consequently observations of this behavior could never be made on earth although milgrom and others have catalogued a respectable sum of persuasive evidence in favor of mond there has not been enough compelling research to conclusively substantiate or disprove the theory calculations suggest that the parameters required to gather direct experimental evidence can be found only far outside our solar system beyond the overwhelming influence of the sun s gravitational field therefore it will be some time before the validity of mond can be directly tested phenomena such as low surface brightness galaxies have yielded an abundance of indirect evidence on the matter but in the absence of more varied data such successes have been viewed as isolated many researchers have criticized mond for adapting its mathematics to the observed mass discrepancy instead of hypothesizing a true physical explanation the theory is the minority view in the astrophysical community overview galaxy dynamics at the start of the one nine eight zero s the first observational evidence was reported that galaxies do not spin as current theories predict a galaxy is a vast group of stars orbiting a bulge at the center of a galaxy since the orbit of stars is driven solely by gravitational force it was expected that stars at the edge would have a much larger orbital period than those near the bulge for example the earth which is one five zero million km from the sun completes an orbit in one year while it takes saturn at a distance of one four billion kilometers from the sun three zero years to do the same a similar behavior was expected from galaxies even if the distribution of stars is more cloud like however it became increasingly apparent that stars at the edge of a galaxy move faster than predicted by conventional theory expected a and observed b galactic rotational curves along with solar rotational curve c postulated dark matter halo around a spiral galaxy astronomers call this phenomenon the flattening of galaxies rotation curve in simple terms drawing a curve to describe the velocity of stars as a function of their distance from the center of a galaxy should yield curve a the dashed line in figure one however data from telescopes yield curve b the plain line instead of decreasing asymptotically to zero as the effect of gravity wanes this curve remains flat at large distances from the bulge by comparison the same curve for our solar system properly scaled is provided curve c in figure one reluctant to change newton s law and einstein s theory of relativity for galaxies alone scientists have simply assumed that the rotation curve was flat because of the presence of a large amount of matter outside galaxies their new theory was that galaxies are embedded in a spherical halo of invisible dark matter figure two however the search for dark matter has since been met with limited success the hypothesis of dark matter halos has encountered many problems that have cast doubt on the validity of this model while it is still the most widely accepted model alternative approaches have been considered of which mond is one the mond theory in one nine eight three mordehai milgrom a physicist at the weizmann institute in israel published two papers on the astrophysical journal to propose a modification of newton s second law of motion basically this law states that an object of mass m subject to a force f undergoes an acceleration a satisfying the simple equation f ma this law is well known to students and has been verified in a variety of situations however it has never been verified in the case where the acceleration a is extremely small and that is exactly what s happening at the scale of galaxies where the distances between stars are so large that the gravitational force is extremely small the change the modification proposed by milgrom is the following instead of f ma the equation should be f m a a zero a where x is a function that for a given variable x gives one if x is much larger than one x one and gives x if x is much smaller than one x one the term a zero is a proposed new constant in the same sense that c the speed of light is a constant except that a zero is acceleration whereas c is speed here is the simple set of equations for the modified newtonian dynamics vec m cdot mu left right vec mu x one mbox x gg one mu x x mbox x ll one f m a a zero a x one if x one x x if x one the exact form of is unspecified only its behavior when the argument x is small or large as milgrom proved in his original paper the form of does not change most of the consequences of the theory such as the flattening of the rotational curve in the everyday world a is much greater than a zero for all physical effects therefore a a zero one and f ma as usual consequently the change in newton s second law is negligible and newton couldn t have seen it since mond was inspired by the desire to solve the flat rotation curve problem it is not a surprise that using the mond theory with observations reconciled this problem this can be shown by a calculation of the new rotation curve mond predicted rotation curve far away from the center of a galaxy the gravitational force a star undergoes is with good approximation f frac with g the gravitation constant m the mass of the galaxy m the mass of the star and r the distance between the center and the star using the new law of dynamics gives f frac m mu right a eliminating m gives frac mu right a we assume that at this large distance r a is smaller than a zero and thus mu right frac which gives frac frac therefore a frac since the equation that relates the velocity to the acceleration for a circular orbit is a frac one has a frac frac and therefore v sqrt four consequently the velocity of stars on a circular orbit far from the center is a constant and doesn t depend on the distance r the rotation curve is flat the proportion between the flat rotation velocity to the observed mass derived here is matching the observed relation between flat velocity to luminosity known as the tully fisher relation at the same time there is a clear relationship between the velocity and the constant a zero the equation v gma zero one four allows one to calculate a zero from the observed v and m milgrom found a zero one two one zero one zero ms two milgrom has noted that this value is also the acceleration you get by dividing the speed of light by the lifetime of the universe if you start from zero velocity with this acceleration you will reach the speed of light roughly in the lifetime of the universe retrospectively the impact of assumed value of a a zero for physical effects on earth remains valid had a zero been larger its consequences would have been visible on earth and since it is not the case the new theory would have been inconsistent consistence with the observations see scientific method for background information according to the modified newtonian dynamics theory every physical process that involves small accelerations will have an outcome different from predicted by the simple law f ma therefore one needs to look for all such processes and verify that mond remains compatible with observations i e within the limit of the uncertainties on the data there is however a complication overlooked until now but that strongly affects our discussion of the compatibility between mond and the observed world here is the problem in a system considered as isolated for example a single satellite orbiting a planet the effect of mond results in an increased velocity beyond a given range actually below a given acceleration but for circular orbits it is the same thing that depends on the mass of both the planet and the satellite however if the same system is actually orbiting a star the planet and the satellite will be accelerated in the star s gravitational field for the satellite the sum of the two fields could yield acceleration greater than a zero and the orbit would not be the same as that in an isolated system for this reason the typical acceleration of any physical process is not the only parameter one must consider also critical is the process environment which is all external forces that are usually neglected in his paper milgrom arranged the typical acceleration of various physical processes in a two dimensional diagram one parameter is the acceleration of the process itself the other parameter is the acceleration induced by the environment how does this affect our discussion of mond s application to the real world very simply all experiments done on earth or its neighborhood are subject to the sun s gravitational field this field is so strong that all objects in the solar system undergo an acceleration greater than a zero that s why mond effects have escaped detection therefore only the dynamics of galaxies and larger systems need to be examined to check that mond is compatible with observation since milgrom s theory first appeared in one nine eight three the most accurate data has come from observations of distant galaxies and neighbors of the milky way within the uncertainties of the data mond has remained valid the milky way itself is scattered with clouds of gas and interstellar dust and until now it has not been possible to draw a rotation curve for our galaxy finally the uncertainties on the velocity of galaxies within clusters and larger systems have been too large to conclude in favor of or against mond is it possible to design an experiment that would confirm mond predictions or rule it out unfortunately conditions for conducting this experiment can be found only outside the solar system however the pioneer and voyager probes are currently traveling beyond pluto and perhaps they have already reached this zone see pioneer anomaly to check that let s calculate the radius of the gravitational sphere of influence of the sun inside which a probe undergoes acceleration greater than a zero we have seen above that the equation relating the acceleration a to the distance r from the sun is frac mu left frac right a so for a a zero assuming a a zero one one with g six six seven one zero eight in cgs units and m the mass of the sun two one zero three three g we get r one zero five one zero one seven cm this is roughly zero zero three four parsecs or zero one light years over one zero zero times the distance between voyager one the most remote probe and the sun it is therefore doubtful that an experiment could be accurate enough to test the departure from newton s second law perhaps one is less than one but it is very likely greater than zero two consequently experiments on mond will have to wait for the next age of space exploration in search for observations that would validate his theory milgrom noticed that a special class of objects the low surface brightness galaxies lsb is of particular interest the radius of a lsb is large compared to its mass and thus almost all stars are within the flat part of the rotation curve also other theories predict that the velocity at the edge depends on the average surface brightness in addition to the lsb mass finally no data on the rotation curve of these galaxies was available at the time milgrom thus could make the prediction that lsbs would have a rotation curve essentially flat and with a relation between the flat velocity and the mass of the lsb identical to that of brighter galaxies since then many such lsbs have been observed and while some astronomers have claimed their data invalidated mond others have been able to confirm their predictions at the time of this writing the debate is still hot and scientists are waiting for more accurate observations the mathematics of mond in non relativistic modified newtonian dynamics poisson s equation nabla two phi n four pi g rho where phi n is the gravitational potential and rho is the density distribution is modified as nabla cdot left mu left frac right nabla phi right four pi g rho where phi is the mond potential the equation is to be solved with boundary condition left nabla phi right rightarrow zero for left mathbf right rightarrow infty the exact form of mu xi is not constrained by observations but must have the behaviour mu xi sim one for xi one newtonian regime mu xi sim xi for xi deep mond regime under deep mond regime modified poisson equation may be rewritten as nabla cdot left frac nabla phi nabla phi n right zero and that simplifies to frac nabla phi nabla phi n nabla times mathbf the vector field mathbf is unknown but is null whenever the density distribution is spherical cylindrical or planar in that case mond acceleration field is given by the simple formula mathbf m mathbf n sqrt n right where mathbf n is the normal newtonian field discussion and criticisms one reason why some astronomers find mond difficult to accept is that it is an effective theory not a physical theory as an effective theory it describes the dynamics of accelerated object with an equation without any physical justification this approach is completely different from einstein s who assumed that some fundamental physical principles were true continuity smoothness and isotropy of space time conservation of energy principle of equivalence and derived new equations from these principles including the famous e mc and the less famous but extremely powerful g eight t for many mond seems to lack a physical ground some new fundamental principle about matter vacuum or space time that would lead to the modified equation f m a a zero a supporters of mond on the other hand have compared theories of dark matter to the now obscure aether hypothesis which was discarded in favor of a fundamental change in our understanding of light instead of postulating the existence of an invisible influence to explain the observed mass discrepancy supporters of mond believe we should re examine our understanding of acceleration attempts in this direction have essentially been modifications of einstein s theory of gravitation when one looks at the equation f m a a zero a the value of a and the parameter of seem to depend on m as well as f however for the gravitational force f also depends on m therefore a change in newton s second law can be a change of the gravitational force or a change of inertia the two are indistinguishable note that this is not true for example for the electromagnetic force moving in the same weak electromagnetic field two particles with the same charge but with different masses would follow fundamentally different trajectories with the same charge the f term in the mond equation is the same for the two particles however with a different value for m one could have a mondian trajectory and not the other even though they are subject to the same force however in interstellar space gravity is the main acting force and since no experiment could be performed on earth to determine whether mond is a new theory of inertia or a new theory of gravity physicists have concentrated their effort on the latter presently they have achieved only partial success devising a more complicated version of einstein s theory of gravitation the most successful relativistic version of mond which was proposed in two zero zero four is known as teves for tensor vector scalar proposed by black hole physicist and milgrom associate jacob d bekenstein it is currently undergoing scholarly review although this most recent incarnation looks promising and even successfully predicts gravitational lensing one must remember that every relativistic theory of gravitation proposed since the emergence of einstein s theory in one nine one five has been ruled out or abandoned since one way or another only the simplest form of einstein s theory has survived the scientific rigors of the past century in the eyes of most cosmologists and astrophysicists mond is considered a possible but unlikely alternative to the more widely accepted theory of dark matter as new data is collected both mond and dark matter are occaisionally invalidated and occasionally supported and no observation has yet conclusively settled the debate toward this goal supporters of mond have concentrated their effort on specific areas to determine phenomena predicted by mond and to search for them for example the dynamics of satellites of our galaxy could be distorted by the effects of mond in such a way that would be difficult to explain with a dark matter halo to obtain the relativistic extension of mond that would incidentally help scientists understand how light is bent by galaxies gravitational field although mond cannot currently cope with this teves has shown promise to otherwise establish mond as a theory of inertia and determine its fundamental principles progress in this direction has been minimal another criticism of mond is that it violates occam s razor which states that the simplest explanation is usually correct any modifications to newton s laws can also be explained in terms of distributions of dark matter and the second explanation is simpler in that it requires fewer changes to rigorously established scientific theory however proponents of mond are quick to point out that extremely hypothetical candidates for dark matter such as wimps six dimensional dark matter theories and the general requirement that dark matter be evenly distributed through space are no simpler than the idea that gravity acts differently at low accelerations beside mond two other theories that try to explain the mystery of the rotational curves is nonsymmetric

searching for an analgesic that would be easier to use during surgery and also have low addiction potential methadone is a schedule ii drug under the single convention on narcotic drugs on september one one one nine four one bockm hl and ehrhart filed an application for a patent for a synthetic substance they called hoechst one zero eight two zero or polamidon and whose structure had no relation to morphine or the opioid alkaloids bockm hl and ehrhart one nine four nine although chemically unlike morphine or heroin methadone also acts on the opioid receptors and thus produces many of the same effects chemically methadone is the simplest of the opioids methadone was introduced into the united states in one nine four seven by eli lilly and company as an analgesic they gave it the trade name dolophine which is now registered to roxane laboratories since then it has been best known for its use in treating narcotic addiction though it is also used in managing chronic pain due to its long duration of action and very low cost in late two zero zero four the cost of a one month supply of methadone is two zero usd as compared to an equivalent analgesic amount of demerol at one two zero usd the old name dolophine comes from the german dolphium the name derives from the latin dolor pain methadone as dolophine was first manufactured in the usa by mallinckrodt pharmaceuticals a st louis based subsidiary of the tyco international corporation mallinckrodt held the patent up until the early one nine nine zero s today a number of pharmaceutical companies produce and distribute methadone however the major producer remains mallinckrodt mallinckrodt sells bulk methadone to most of the producers of generic preparations and also distributes its own brand name product in the form of tablets dispersable tablets and oral concentrate under the name methadose in the united states generally one will only hear dolophine used by older addicts who used the product in the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s medical professionals who believe that dolophine is the generic name for methadone when actually it is the reverse may also use the old brand name methadone has a slow metabolism and very high lipid solubility making it longer lasting than morphine based drugs methadone has a typical half life of two four four eight hours permitting the administration only once a day in heroin detoxification and maintenance programs the most common mode of delivery at a methadone clinic is in an oral solution methadone is almost as effective when administered orally as by injection just like heroin tolerance and dependence frequently develop current research in this area shows methadone has a unique affinity for the nmda brain receptor some researchers propose that nmda n methyl d aspartic acid may regulate psychic dependence and tolerance by exhibiting opioid antagonist like activity withdrawal symptoms are generally less acutely severe than those of morphine and heroin at equivalent doses but are significantly more prolonged considered generally effective in management of heroin addiction and harm reduction reduction of hiv rates etc at proper dosing it reduces the appetite for heroin however some heroin addicts feel that it is actually harder to quit methadone than heroin itself treatment at a methadone maintenance clinic is intended to be for an indefinite duration as the treatment is not curative in recent years methadone has gained popularity among physicians for the treatment of chronic pain the increased usage comes as doctors search for an opioid drug that can be dosed less frequently than short acting drugs such as morphine or hydrocodone methadone with its long half life oral bioavailability and long duration of effect is a common second choice drug for pain that doesn t respond to weaker agonists although not common methadone is encountered on the illicit market and has been associated with a number of overdose deaths street meth demand comes primarily from opioid addicts unable to get into a legal methadone program addicts seeking a high strongly prefer shorter acting opioids studies have shown that the vast majority of methadone diverted to the illicit market comes from pain management prescriptions or theft from factories shippers not from maintenance patients closely related to methadone the synthetic compound levo alphacetylmethadol or laam orlaam has an even longer duration of action from four eight to seven two hours permitting a reduction in frequency of use in one nine nine four it was approved as a treatment of narcotic addiction like methadone laam is in schedule ii of the united states controlled substances act laam has since been removed from the us and european markets due to reports of rare cardiac side effects buprenorphine has also been used in the treatment of narcotic addiction in october two zero zero two the fda approved two compounds containing buprenorphine subutex and suboxone for the treatment of narcotic addiction it is interesting to note that subutex and suboxone are in schedule iii of the united states controlled substances act which allow for their use on an outpatient basis unlike methadone and laam in the uk and many other countries however not only buprenorphine and methadone but also diamorphine heroin and other opioids are regularly used for outpatient treatment of opiate addiction and treatment is generally provided in much less heavily regulated environments than in the united states a recent study from austria indicated that oral morphine provides better results than oral methadone and studies of heroin maintenance have indicated that a low background dose of methadone combined with heroin maintenance may significantly improve outcomes for less responsive patients another close relative of methadone is dextropropoxyphene first marketed in one nine five seven under the trade name of darvon oral analgesic potency is one half

was later generalized to other m bius inversion formulas see incidence algebra the classic version states that if g n and f n are arithmetic functions satisfying g n sum f d quad mboxn ge one then f n sum g d mu n d quad mboxn ge one where is the m bius function and the sums extend over all positive divisors d of n in effect the original f n can be determined given g n by using the inversion formula the two sequences are said to be m bius transforms of each other the formula is also correct if f and g are functions from the positive integers into some abelian group in the language of convolutions see multiplicative function and dirichlet convolution the inversion formula can also be expressed as one an equivalent formulation of the inversion formula more useful in combinatorics is as follows suppose f x and g x are complex valued functions defined on the interval one such that g x sum f x n quad mboxx ge one then f x sum mu n g x n quad mboxx ge one here the sums extend over all positive integers n which are less than or equal to x the m bius inversion treated above is the original m bius inversion when the partially ordered set of natural numbers ordered by divisibility one is replaced by other locally finite partially ordered sets one has other m bius inversion formulas for an account of those see incidence algebra common functions a series of functions on the positive integers can be defined by the transform in the first equation above if one starts with euler s totient function and repeatedly apply the transformation process the following functions are the result one phi n totient function two f n n identity function three sigma n divisor function if the starting function is the m bius function itself the list of functions is one mu n m bius function two epsilon n begin one mboxn mbox zero mboxn end the unit function also written as u n three f n one constant function one four tau n number of divisors of n see divisor function both of these lists of functions extend infinitely in both directions the m bius inversion formula enables these lists to be traversed backwards physics physicists have shown that the m bius inversion formula can in the context of a theory with a logarithmic spectrum be obtained by means of supersymmetry and a witten index calculation see also lambert series arithmetic functions combinatorics thomas martin

the book was a success and marvel began publishing further superhero titles featuring such heroes and anti heroes as the hulk spider man the mighty thor ant man iron man the x men and daredevil and such memorable antagonists as doctor doom magneto galactus the green goblin and doctor octopus the most successful new series was the amazing spider man by stan lee and steve ditko marvel s comics were noted for focusing on characterization to a greater extent than most superhero comics before them this was true of spider man in particular its young hero suffered from self doubt and mundane

the one nine six zero s dc was the equivalent of the big hollywood studios after the brilliance of dc s reinvention of the superhero in the late one nine five zero s and early one nine six zero s it had run into a creative drought by the decade s end there was a new audience for comics now and it wasn t just the little kids that traditionally had read the books the marvel of the one nine six zero s was in its own way the counterpart of the french new wave marvel was pioneering new methods of comics storytelling and characterization addressing more serious themes and in the process keeping and attracting readers in their teens and beyond moreover among this new generation of readers were people who wanted to write or draw comics themselves within the new style that marvel had pioneered and push the creative envelope still further lee became one of the best known names in comics with his charming personality and relentless salesmanship of the company the voice of stan lee is what one senses in so many of the marvel comics of the first half of the one nine six zero s his sense of humor and generally lighthearted manner and the depiction of the bullpen lee s name for the staff as one big happy family it later became clear the artists often had as much to do with marvel s product and success as lee jack kirby in particular is often credited as the creative well from which sprang many of the cosmic ideas and characters of fantastic four and the mighty thor such as the watcher the silver surfer and ego the living planet while steve ditko is recognized as the driving artistic force behind the moody atmosphere and street level naturalism of spider man and the surreal atmosphere of dr strange lee however continues to deserve great credit for his well honed skills at dialog and story sense for his keen hand at choosing and motivating artists and assembling creative teams and for his uncanny ability to connect with the readers in one nine six eight company founder

diversify and achieved moderate success with titles themed to horror tomb of dracula martial arts shang chi master of kung fu sword and sorcery conan the barbarian red sonja satire howard the duck and science fiction killraven in amazing adventures some of these were published in larger sized black and white magazines targeted for mature readers marvel was able to capitalize on its successful superhero comics of the previous decade by acquiring a new newsstand distributor and greatly expanding its comics line even more importantly during a time when the price and format of the standard newsstand comic were in flux marvel captured a significant piece of dc s market share by offering a lower priced product with a higher distributor discount in one nine seven three perfect film and chemical corporation changed its name to cadence industries which in turn renamed magazine management co as marvel comics group goodman now completely disconnected from marvel created a new company called atlas seaboard comics in one nine seven four reviving marvel s old atlas name but this project lasted only a year and a half in the mid one nine seven zero s marvel was affected by a decline of the newsstand distribution network cult hits such as howard the duck were the victims of the distribution problems with some titles reporting low sales when in fact they were being resold at a later date in the first specialty comic book stores an attempt by marvel to buy dc was frustrated by dc s refusal to sell its entire library of characters wanting to retain control of superman and batman and dc was sold to warner communications instead by the end of the decade marvel s fortunes were reviving thanks to the rise of direct market distribution selling through those same comics specialty stores instead of newsstands and the sales increase of previously borderline books such as the canceled six zero s title the uncanny x men revived to become a hit series under the team of writer chris

owned material in one nine eight two and launching a brand new albeit ultimately unsuccessful line named new universe to commemorate marvel s two five th anniversary in one nine eight six however shooter was responsible for the introduction of the company wide crossover contest of champions secret wars and was accused by many creators especially near the end of his tenure of exercising his job

comics code authority and established its own marvel ratings system for comics it also created new imprints such as max a line intended for mature readers and marvel age developed for younger audiences including children in addition to this is the highly successful ultimate marvel imprint which allowed marvel to reboot their major titles by deconstructing and updating their major superhero and villain characters to introduce to a new generation this imprint exists in a universe parallel to the proper marvel continuity which allowed the writers freedom from the characters convoluted history and the ability to redesign them and to maintain their other ongoing series without replacing the established continuity this also allowed marvel to capitalize on an influx of new readers who were not familiar with comics but became familiar with their characters through their film franchises making it easier for a mainstream audience to follow the company has also revamped its graphic novel division establishing a bigger presence in the bookstore market marvel remains a key publisher in the comics business even as the industry has dwindled to a fraction of its peak size decades earlier stan lee is no longer officially connected to the company save for the title of chairman emeritus but remains a visible face in the industry and occasionally remarks on his fondness for the characters in two zero zero two he sued successfully for a share of income related to movies and merchandising of marvel characters based on a contract between lee and marvel from the late one nine nine zero s according to court documents marvel had used hollywood accounting to claim that those projects earnings were not profits regardless marvel has also become a key player in hollywood with many of its characters being turned into successful film franchises with perhaps the best examples being x men starting in two zero zero zero and spider man beginning in two zero zero two marvel has

within the marvel universe over superhero registration editors in chief the marvel editor in chief oversees the largest scale creative decisions taken within the company while the fabled stan lee held great authority during the decades when publisher martin goodman privately held his company of which the comics division was a relatively small part his successors have been to greater and lesser extents subject to corporate management the position evolved sporadically in the earliest years the company had a single editor overseeing the entire line as the company grew it became increasingly common for individual titles to be overseen separately the concept of the writer editor evolved stemming from when lee wrote and managed most of the line s output overseeing the line in the one nine seven zero s was a series of chief editors though the titles were used intermittently confusing matters further some appear to have been appointed merely by extending their existing editorial duties by the time jim shooter took the post in one nine seven eight the position of editor in chief was clearly defined in one nine nine four marvel briefly abolished the position replacing tom defalco with

monster is an individual organism or new genetic character arising or resulting from an instance of mutation which is a sudden structural change within the dna of a gene or chromosome of an organism resulting in the creation of a new character or trait not found in the parental type in an organism or individual the new character or trait may or may not be trivial but it is rarely beneficial and will usually result in either a genetic disorder or have no observable effect whatsoever occasionally a body cell in a healthy organism may acquire a mutation caused by a genetic error occurring during routine cell division such an error may result in cancer one of the most famous mutants is the blue lobster it is caused by a mutation that happens to one out of four million lobsters see also

ability merit rather than by wealth race or other determinants of social position however the word meritocracy is now often used to describe a type of society where wealth income and social status are assigned through competition on the assumption that the winners do indeed deserve merit their resulting advantage as a result the word has acquired a connotation of social darwinism and is used to describe aggressively competitive societies with large inequality of income and wealth contrasted with egalitarian societies meritocratic governments and organizations stress talent formal education and competence rather than existing differences such as social class ethnicity or sex in practice research on social mobility indicates that all these supposedly neutral criteria favour the children of those who are already privileged in some way in a representative democracy where power is theoretically in the hands of the elected representatives meritocratic elements include the use of expert consultants to help formulate policies and a meritocratic civil service to implement them the perennial problem in advocating meritocracy is defining exactly what one means by merit origin of term the term was first used in a pejorative sense in michael young s one nine five eight book rise of the meritocracy which is set in a dystopian future in which one s social place is determined by iq plus effort in the book this social system ultimately leads to a social revolution in which the masses overthrow the elite who have become arrogant and disconnected from the feelings of the public despite the negative origin of the word there are many who believe that a meritocratic system is a good thing for society proponents of meritocracy argue that a meritocratic system is more just and more productive than other systems and that it allows for an end to distinctions based on such things as sex and race though social classes would still exist young s central criticism of meritocracy was that a system in which social position is determined by objective characteristics would still be inegalitarian and unstable there have since been other lines of criticism proponents of critical theory often argue that merit is defined by the power elite simply to legitimise a system in which social status is actually determined by class birth and wealth often opponents of the concept of meritocracy argue that characteristics such as intelligence or effort are simply impossible to measure accurately for example one may ask who was more intelligent isaac newton or albert einstein therefore in their view any implementation of meritocracy necessarily involves a high degree of guesswork and is inherently flawed social darwinism social darwinism is a social theory which holds that darwin s theory of evolution by natural selection is not only a model for the development of biological traits in a population but can also be applied to human social institutions social darwinisim was popular in the late one nine th century to the end of world war ii although some have claimed that contemporary sociobiology could be classified as a form of social darwinism proponents of social darwinism often used the theory to justify social inequality as being meritocratic others used it to justify racism and imperialism at its most extreme some social darwinism appears to anticipate eugenics and the race doctrines of the nazis while social darwinism applies the concept of evolution and natural selection to human cultural systems none of the political and quasi theological ideologies related to it are a part of darwin s biological theory of evolution equally social darwinism itself does not necessarily engender a political position some social darwinists argue for the inevitability of progress while others emphasize the potential for the degeneration of humanity some even attempted to enroll social darwinism in reformist politics the theory of social darwinism draws on the work of many authors including herbert spencer and thomas malthus individual proponents confucius in teaching there should be no distinction of classes analects xv three nine tr legge many western admirers of confucius like voltaire or h g creel have pointed out an innovative and revolutionary idea of confucius he replaced the nobility of blood with one of virtue j nz which had meant noble man slowly took on a new meaning in his sayings something like the english gentleman a virtuous plebeian who cultivates his qualities could be a gentleman whilst a shameless son of a king was only a small man that he allowed any kind of student to be his disciple his teachings were intended to train future rulers is a clear indication that he didn t wholly support feudal structures in chinese society han feizi in addition to confucius another ancient chinese philosopher of the same period the warring states advocated a meritocratic system of government and society this was han feizi who was famous as being the foremost proponent of the school of law otherwise known as the philosophy of legalism the central tenet of his argument was the absolute rule of law though there were also numerous meritocratic elements another legalist shang yang implemented legalist and meritocratic reforms in the state of qin by abolishing the aristocracy and promoting individuals based on skill intelligence and initiative this led to the armies of the qin having a critical edge over the other nations that adhered to old aristocratic systems of government legalism along with its anti aristocratic pro meritocratic ideals remained a key part of chinese philosophy and politics for another two millennia although after the qin dynasty it was heavily diluted genghis khan meritocracy was the primary basis for selection of chiefs and generals in the mongol empire genghis khan chose whomever was talented and fit for his military chain of command he even trusted generals and soldiers from opponents armies if they showed loyalty to their leaders for example genghis khan s general jebe had been an enemy soldier who had shot genghis s horse in battle before he became great khan napoleon napoleonic revolutionary france is also sometimes considered to have been meritocratic after the revolution of one seven nine two hardly a member of the former elite remained when napoleon rose to power therefore there was no ancient base from which to draw his staff and he had to choose the people he thought best for the job including officers from his army revolutionaries who had been in the people s assembly and even some former aristocrats such as prime minister talleyrand a later non meritocratic practice however was the appointment of family members and corsican friends to important positions specifically regional leadership loyalty may have been a more important factor than sheer merit in performance a common case in political situations meritocratic states singapore among modern nation states the republic of singapore claims to aspire to be a pure meritocracy with its supposed emphasis on identifying and grooming bright young citizens for positions of leadership there is also an emphasis on academic credentials these are seen as objective measures of both intelligence and effort which in turn are arbitrarily determined by the ruling party of singapore the people s action party its unwillingness to tolerate political dissent casts some skepticism on its claims of meritocracy and within its party ideology political conformity is a measure of merit thereby distorting its original meaning meritocracy is supposed to be a central political concept in singapore and is at the heart of its founding myth specifically singapore portrays itself as having been expelled from neighbouring malaysia in one nine six five as a result of the unwillingness of its majority immigrant groups especially the ethnic chinese to accept the special position of the indigenous communities especially the malays the federal malaysian government had argued for a system which would give special privileges to the malays as part of their birthright as an indigenous people in time the federal government came to implement an affirmative action policy that favoured the numerically preponderant but economically backward indigenous groups the singapore government supposedly argued for the equality of all citizens of malaysia with places in universities government contracts political appointments etc going to the most deserving candidate rather than to one chosen on the basis of connections or ethnic background in the ensuing conflict between state and federal governments through the machinations of the politicians of the day singapore was expelled and became an independent city state however the reality of the singaporean political and economic system is anything but meritocratic double standards exist even politically the only political activism seen since independence was when the government s interests aligned with those of the activists dissidents and seditious activities are not allowed the bulk of the singaporean economy comprises of government linked companies of which senior members of the people s action party are routinely selected to become directors and ceos in a non transparent fashion rather than focusing on other qualities that would determine merit such as experience in running large mncs and other more impressive credentials that other candidates may possess the most famous and oft cited example of singapore s alleged nepotism is that of temasek holdings inc the managing director of which the daughter in law of singapore s founding father lee kuan yew ho ching became when there was no shortage of other better qualified candidates grand duchy of finland another example is the one nine th century finland which was formally ruled by an autocrat though in practice governing was left to the educated class although ancestry and inherited wealth influenced one s educational opportunities education and not ancestry was the principal requirement for admittance to and promotion within the civil service and government well into the mid two zero th century academic degrees remained important factors for politicians asking for the electorate s confidence meritocratic civilization western civilization the anglosphere and western europe western civilization as a whole is based largely on principles of meritocracy the primary difference between the anglosphere and western europe being that anglophone countries focus on merit regardless of inherited advantages while continental countries prefer to assess merit after giving roughly the same opportunities to everyone the principles of equality under the law the system of common law the prevalence of the market system which rewards merit however achieved the democratic system whereby citizens can choose those they believe to be of the greatest merit and the strong constitutional emphasis on individual rights are all unique developments of western civilization which have the effect of approximating meritocracy better than traditional civilizations although a conflict exists between those who believe that everyone should have the same opportunities and those who believe the most capable should rule regardless of how they came to be the most capable western civilization is distinguished by its focus on individual merit over collectivism or state authority see also meritocracy in china participatory economics participatory democracy aristocracy consensus democracy majoritarianism nepotism racialism external links world wide words michael quinion writes about the changing use of the term forms of government political neologisms marxism leninism russian strictly speaking refers to the version of marxist theory developed by vladimir lenin see leninism however in various contexts different and sometimes opposing political groups have used the term marxism leninism to describe the ideologies that they claimed to be upholding the purpose of this article is to give an account of the historical and present uses of the label marxism leninism history of the term lenin himself never used the term leninism nor did he refer to his views as marxism leninism however his ideas diverged from classical marxist theory on several important points see the articles on marxism and leninism for more information bolshevik communists saw these differences as advancements of marxism made by lenin after lenin s death his ideology and contributions to marxist theory were termed marxism leninism or sometimes only leninism marxism leninism soon became the official name for the ideology of the comintern and of communist parties around the world within five years of lenin s death joseph stalin completed his rise to power in the soviet union stalin in contrast to many contemporary revolutionaries did not write a significant body of theoretical work stalinism strictly speaking refers to a style of government or political structure rather than an ideology per se during the period of stalin s rule in the soviet union marxism leninism was proclaimed the official ideology of the state whether stalin s practices actually followed the principles of marx and lenin is still a subject of debate amongst historians and political scientists trotskyists in particular believe that stalinism contradicted authentic marxism and leninism and they intitially used the term bolshevik leninism to describe their own ideology of anti stalinist and anti maoist communism after the sino soviet split the soviet union and the people s republic of china each claimed to be the sole intellectual heir to marxism leninism in china the claim that mao had adapted marxism leninism to chinese conditions evolved into the idea that he had updated it in a fundamental way applying to the world as a whole consequently the term marxism leninism mao zedong thought commonly known as maoism was increasingly used to describe the official chinese state ideology as well as the ideological basis of parties around the world who sympathized with the communist party of china following the death of mao american maoists associated with the revolutionary communist party usa subsequently coined the term marxism leninism maoism arguing that maoism was a more advanced stage of marxism maoist and maoist oriented parties today generally believe that the current leadership of china has abandoned maoism in north korea marxism leninism was officially superseded in one nine seven seven by juche in which concepts of class and class struggle in other words marxism itself play no significant role however the government is still sometimes referred to as marxist leninist or more commonly stalinist due to its political and economic structure see history of north korea the other three communist states existing today cuba vietnam and laos hold marxism leninism as their official ideology although they give it different interpretations in terms of practical policy current usage most communist parties continue to regard marxism leninism as their basic ideology although many have modified it to adapt to new political conditions several communist parties especially those previously associated with eurocommunism have distanced themselves from the concept of marxism leninism and in many cases omitted it from their official documents some have started identifying themselves as marxist leninist or marxist and leninist rather than marxist leninist the difference in such cases is that the historical connotation of marxism leninism is avoided in party names the appellation marxist leninist is normally used by a communist party who wishes to distinguish itself from some other and presumably mainstream communist party in the same country most often parties who place the term marxist leninist in their official name are those originating from the anti revisionist tradition such as maoist groups popular confusion abounds concerning the complex terminology describing the various schools of marxist derived thought the appellation marxist leninist is often used by those not familiar with communist ideology in any detail e g many newspapers and other media as a synonym for any kind of marxism communism political theories the word modulo is the latin ablative of modulus it was introduced into mathematics in the book disquisitiones arithmeticae by carl friedrich gauss in one eight zero one ever since however modulo has gained many meanings some exact and some imprecise this usage is from gauss s book given the integers a b and n the expression a b mod n pronounced a is congruent to b modulo n means that a and b have the same remainder when divided by n or equivalently that a b is a multiple of n for more details see modular arithmetic in computing given two integers a and n a modulo n is the remainder after numerical division of a by n under certain constraints see modulo operation two members of a ring or an algebra are congruent modulo an ideal if the difference between them is in the ideal two members a and b of a group are congruent modulo a normal subgroup iff ab one is a member of the normal subgroup see quotient group and isomorphism theorem two subsets of an infinite set are equal modulo finite sets precisely if their symmetric difference is finite that is you can take a finite piece from the first infinite set then add a finite piece to it and get as result the second infinite set the most general precise definition is simply in terms of an equivalence relation r we say that a is equivalent or congruent to b modulo r if arb in the mathematical community the word modulo is also used informally in many imprecise ways generally to say a is the same as b modulo c means more or less a and b are the same except for differences accounted for or explained by c see modulo

march two one nine three one was leader of the soviet union from one nine eight five until one nine nine one his attempts at reform led to the end of the cold war but also caused the end of the political supremacy of the communist party of the soviet union cpsu and the dissolution of the soviet union he was awarded the nobel peace prize in one nine nine zero early life and political career mikhail gorbachev was born into a peasant family in the village of privolnoye near stavropol gorbachev studied law at moscow university where he met his future wife raisa they married in september one nine five three and moved to gorbachev s home region of stavropol in southern russia when he graduated in one nine five five gorbachev joined the cpsu in one nine five two at the age of two one in one nine six six at age three five he obtained a correspondence degree as an agronomist economist from the agricultural institute his career moved forward rapidly and in one nine seven zero he was appointed first secretary for agriculture and the following year made a member of the central committee in one nine seven two he headed a soviet delegation to belgium and two years later in one nine seven four he was made a representative to the supreme soviet and chairman of the standing commission on youth affairs in one nine seven nine gorbachev was promoted to the politburo there he received the patronage of yuri andropov head of the kgb and also a native of stavropol and was promoted during andropov s brief time as leader of the party before andropov s death in one nine eight four with responsibility over personnel working together with andropov two zero percent of the top echelon of government ministers and regional governors were replaced often with younger men during this time grigory romanov nikolai ryzhkov and yegor ligachev were elevated the latter two working closely with gorbachev ryzhkov on economics ligachev on personnel he was also close to konstantin chernenko andropov s successor serving as second secretary his positions within the new cpsu created more opportunities to travel abroad and this would profoundly affect his political and social views in the future as leader of the country in one nine seven five he led a delegation to west germany and in one nine eight three he headed a soviet delegation to canada to meet with prime minister pierre trudeau and members of the canadian house of commons and senate in one nine eight four he traveled to the united kingdom where he met with prime minister margaret thatcher general secretary of the cpsu upon the death of konstantin chernenko mikhail gorbachev at age five four was elected general secretary of the communist party on march one one one nine eight five he became the party s first leader to have been born after the russian revolution of one nine one seven as de facto ruler of the soviet union he tried to reform the stagnating communist party and the state economy by introducing glasnost openness perestroika restructuring and uskoreniye acceleration of economic development which were launched at the two seven th congress of the cpsu in february one nine eight six reforms and democratization gorbachev in one on one discussions with u s president ronald reagan domestic reforms domestically gorbachev implemented economic reforms that he hoped would improve living standards and worker productivity as part of his perestroika program however many of his reforms were considered radical at the time by orthodox apparatchiks in the soviet government in one nine eight five gorbachev announced that the soviet economy was stalled and that reorganization was needed initially his reforms were called uskoreniye acceleration but later the term perestroika reconstruction became much more popular the first reform introduced under gorbachev was the one nine eight five alcohol reform which was designed to fight wide spread alcoholism in the soviet union prices on vodka wine and beer were lifted and their sales were restricted people who were caught drunk at work or in public were prosecuted drinking on long distance trains and in public places was banned many famous wineries were destroyed scenes of alcohol consumption were cut out from the movies the reform did not have any significant effect on the alcoholism in the country but economically it was a complete disaster and a serious blow to the state budget a loss of approximately one zero zero billion rubles according to alexander yakovlev after alcohol production migrated to black market economy alcohol reform was one of the initial triggers that caused a chain of events that ended with the collapse of the soviet union and deep economical crisis in the newly formed cis six years later citation needed the law on cooperatives enacted in may one nine eight eight was perhaps the most radical of the economic reforms during the early part of the gorbachev era for the first time since vladimir lenin s new economic policy the law permitted private ownership of businesses in the services manufacturing and foreign trade sectors the law initially imposed high taxes and employment restrictions but these were later revised to avoid discouraging private sector activity under this provision cooperative restaurants shops and manufacturers became part of the soviet scene gorbachev s introduction of glasnost gave new freedoms to the people such as a greater freedom of speech this was a radical change as control of speech and suppression of government criticism had previously been a central part of the soviet system the press became far less controlled and thousands of political prisoners and many dissidents were released gorbachev s goal in undertaking glasnost was to pressure conservatives within the cpsu who opposed his policies of economic restructuring and he also hoped that through different ranges of openness debate and participation the soviet people would support his reform initiatives in january one nine eight seven gorbachev called for democratization the infusion of democratic elements such as multi candidate elections into the soviet political process in june one nine eight eight at the cpsu s nineteenth party conference gorbachev launched radical reforms meant to reduce party control of the government apparatus in december one nine eight eight the supreme soviet approved the establishment of a congress of people s deputies which constitutional amendments had established as the soviet union s new legislative body elections to the congress were held throughout the ussr in march and april one nine eight nine on march one five one nine nine zero gorbachev was elected as the first executive president of the soviet union time magazine cover of january four one nine eight eight featuring gorbachev as man of the year new thinking abroad in international affairs gorbachev sought to improve relations and trade with the west he established close relationships with several western leaders such as margaret thatcher who famously remarked i like mr gorbachev we can do business together west german chancellor helmut kohl and u s president ronald reagan on october one one one nine eight six gorbachev and reagan met in reykjav k iceland to discuss reducing intermediate range nuclear weapons in europe this led to the signing of the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty inf in one nine eight seven in february one nine eight eight gorbachev announced the withdrawal of soviet forces from afghanistan the withdrawal was completed the following year although the civil war continued as the mujahedin pushed to overthrow the pro soviet najibullah regime an estimated one five zero zero zero soviets were killed between one nine seven nine and one nine eight nine as a result of the conflict see soviet war in afghanistan also during one nine eight eight gorbachev announced that the soviet union would abandon the brezhnev doctrine and allow the eastern bloc nations to determine their own internal affairs this proved to be the most far reaching of gorbachev s foreign policy reforms with his foreign ministry spokesman gennadi gerasimov jokingly calling his new doctrine the sinatra doctrine moscow s abandonment of the brezhnev doctrine led to a string of revolutions in eastern europe throughout one nine eight nine in which communism collapsed with the exception of romania the popular upheavals against the pro soviet communist regimes were all peaceful ones see revolutions of one nine eight nine the loosening of soviet hegemony over eastern europe effectively ended the cold war and for this gorbachev was awarded the nobel peace prize on october one five one nine nine zero the new encyclop dia britannica labelled gorbachev the single most important initiator of a series of events in late one nine eight nine and one nine nine zero that transformed the political fabric of europe and marked the beginning of the end of the cold war ronald reagan nancy reagan raisa gorbachyova and mikhail gorbachev december eight one nine eight seven coup and collapse while gorbachev s political initiatives were positive for freedom and democracy in the soviet union and eastern europe the economic policy of his government gradually brought the country close to disaster by the end of one nine eight zero s severe shortages of basic food supplies meat sugar led to reintroduction of the war time system of distribution using food cards that limited each citizen to a certain amount of product per month compared to one nine eight five state deficit grew from zero to one zero nine billion rubles gold funds decreased from two zero zero zero to two zero zero tonn and external debt grew from zero to one two zero billion dollars furthermore the democratization of the ussr and eastern europe had irreparably undermined the power of the cpsu and gorbachev himself gorbachev s relaxation of censorship and attempts to create more political openness had the unintended effect of re awakening long suppressed nationalist and anti russian feelings in the soviet republics calls for greater independence from moscow s rule grew louder especially in the baltic republics of estonia lithuania and latvia which had been annexed into the soviet union by stalin in one nine four zero nationalist feeling also took hold in the soviet republics of georgia ukraine armenia and azerbaijan gorbachev had unleashed a force that would ultimately destroy the soviet union gorbachev s response to growing republic separatism was to draw up a new treaty of union which would have created a truly voluntary federation in an increasingly democratised ussr the new treaty was strongly supported by the central asian republics who needed the economic power and markets of the soviet union to prosper however the more radical reformists such as russian sfsr president boris yeltsin were increasingly convinced that a rapid transition to a market economy was required and were more than happy to contemplate the disintegration of the ussr if that was required to achieve their aims gorbachev accused boris yeltsin his old rival and russia s first post soviet president of tearing the country apart out of a desire to advance his own personal interests in contrast to the reformers lukewarm approach to the new treaty the hard line apparatchiks still strong within the cpsu and military establishment were completely opposed to anything which might lead to breakup of the soviet motherland on the eve of the treaty s signing the hardliners struck hard liners in the soviet leadership launched the august coup in one nine nine one in an attempt to remove gorbachev from power and prevent the signing of the new union treaty during this time gorbachev spent three days august one nine to two one under house arrest at a dacha in the crimea before being freed and restored to power however upon his return gorbachev found that neither union nor russian power structures heeded his commands as support had swung over to yeltsin whose defiance had led to the coup s collapse furthermore gorbachev was forced to fire large numbers of his politburo and in several cases arrest them those arrested for high treason include the gang of eight that had led the coup gorbachev had aimed to maintain the cpsu as a united party but move it in the direction of social democracy the inherent contradictions in this approach praising lenin admiring sweden s social model and seeking to maintain the annexation of the baltic states by military force were difficult enough but when the cpsu was proscribed after the august coup gorbachev was left with no effective power base beyond the armed forces in the end yeltsin won them round too with promises of more money gorbachev eventually resigned on december two five one nine nine one as the ussr was officially dissolved gorbachev is generally well regarded in the west for having ended the cold war however in russia his reputation is very low because he is perceived to have brought about the collapse of the country and is held responsible for the economic misery that followed nevertheless polls indicate that a majority of russians are pleased with the result of the individual aims of perestroika gorbachev s chief legislative legacy and the freedom that came about as a result nor is he considered by all to be the sole reason the cold war ended as it did the war in afghanistan had been going on since the late one nine seven zero s draining soviet resources this and many revolutionary movements in soviet satellite states well funded and supplied by clandenstine operations from the west most notably afghanistan and poland took a huge toll on the union s ability to keep order and operate as a government armament buildups in the west also prompted likewise military expenditures that when added to expenditures in afghanistan could not be maintained soviet economy infrastructure was in serious decay by one nine eight five when gorbachev took office and these events would have had a huge impact on gorbachev s decisions to liberalize in the end these attempts to open the soviet union were too little too late and satellite nations responded accordingly ending a nearly five zero year stalemate between east and west political activity after resignation gorbachev founded the gorbachev foundation in one nine nine two in one nine nine three he also founded green cross international of which he was one of three major sponsors of the earth charter he also became a member of the club of rome in one nine nine six gorbachev re ran for president in russia but only received about one of the vote most likely due to his animosity following the soviet union s collapse in one nine nine seven gorbachev starred in a pizza hut commercial made for the usa to raise money for the perestroika archives on november two six two zero zero one gorbachev also founded the social democratic party of russia which is a union between several russian social democrat parties he resigned as party leader in may two zero zero four over a disagreement with the party s chairman over the direction taken in the december two zero zero three election campaign in early two zero zero four gorbachev moved to trademark his famous port wine birthmark after a vodka company featured the mark on labels of one of their drinks to capitalize on its fame the company now no longer uses the trademark gorbachev to trademark his forehead in june two zero zero four gorbachev represented russia at the funeral of ronald reagan in september two zero zero four following chechen militant attacks across russia president vladimir putin launched an initiative to replace the election of regional governors with a system whereby they would be directly appointed by the president and approved by regional legislatures gorbachev together with boris yeltsin criticized putin s actions as a step away from democracy in two zero zero five gorbachev was awarded the point alpha prize for his role in supporting german reunification he also received an honorary doctorate from the university of m nster he currently resides in moscow trivia in the west gorbachev was colloquially known as gorby in part because of a perception that he was less austere than his predecessors in one nine eight seven gorbachev acknowledged that his liberalizing policies of glasnost and perestroika owed a great deal to alexander dub ek s socialism with a human face when asked what the difference was between the prague spring and his own reforms gorbachev replied nineteen years in one nine eight nine on an official visit to china during the demonstrations in tiananmen square shortly before the imposition of martial law in beijing gorbachev was asked for his opinion on the great wall of china it s a very beautiful work he replied but there are already too many walls between people a journalist asked him would you like the berlin wall to be taken down gorbachev replied very seriously why not gorbachev was ranked nine five on michael h hart s list of the most influential figures in history gorbachev is the mascot to a small unorthodox support group in virginia known as kajn and serves as a symbol of their unity and love for mother russia he is also a recurring cameo in many of their short

members of the militia of the american colonies who would be ready for battle in a minute s notice the term minutemen has also been applied to various later united states military units to recall the success and patriotism of the originals see minutemen history as early as one six four five in the massachusetts bay colony some men were selected from the general ranks of town based training bands to be ready for rapid deployment the militia in the province of massachusetts had a long history of extended conflict see king philip s war french and indian wars and battle of lexington and concord every generation of new englander had known fighting every town had a militia and every man between one six and six zero years of age was asked to join most of these men were farmers many were descendants of the few original settlers of each town and so it was very common to be fighting alongside cousins and in laws some towns in massachusetts had a long history of designating a portion of their militia as minutemen but others prefered to keep their entire militia in a single unit after the powder alarm in the fall of one seven seven four patriot leaders in the newly formed massachusetts provincial congress recommended that all militias contain minute companies special units within the militia system whose members underwent additional training and to hold themselves ready to turn out quickly at a minute s notice for emergencies some towns followed this recommendation and altered their unit structures but some took no action the minutemen were usually two five years of age or younger and they were chosen for their enthusiasm reliability and strength they were the first armed militia to arrive or await a battle officers were elected by popular vote and each unit drafted a formal written covenant to be signed upon enlistment they typically assembled four times per year for training during peacetime it was common sometimes even in the middle of battle for officers to make decisions through consultation with their men as opposed to giving orders to be followed without question popular histories of the battle of lexington and concord in one seven seven five the first battle of the american revolutionary war have often labelled all the irregulars on the american side as minutemen most notably captain john parker s lexington militia but at the time of the battle all of lexington s militiamen were organized into a single large unit and were still called by the archaic name of town training band other colonies faced with similar problems had organized similar minute companies over time minutemen became a generic term for any american militia motivation the new england town meeting style of local decision making in combination with the colonial legislature meant that for nearly all functions of government these men had already experienced generations of self rule even though most of them could not express lofty sentiments about the rights of man and the purposes of government they knew that the same british army of professional soldiers who had once fought with them against a common enemy was now in their land to take something important away from them one massachusetts man used the phrase an englishman s home is his castle when he explained to his friends why he had barricaded himself behind his front door to fight the british army as it passed by during the final phase of the battle of lexington and concord the typical individual american patriot in massachusetts fought for a political idea even at this first stage of the war when independence from great britain was not yet a common sentiment equipment training and tactics most colonial militia units were provided neither arms nor uniforms and so had to equip themselves many simply wore their own farmers or workmans clothes while others had buckskin hunting outfits some added indian style touches to intimidate the enemy even including war paint most used hunting rifles which did not have bayonets but were accurate at long range the continental army regulars received european style military training later in the american revolutionary war but the militias did not get much of this rather than fight formal battles in the traditional dense lines and columns they were better when used as irregulars primarily as skirmishers and sharpshooters their experience suited irregular warfare most were familiar with frontier hunting the indian wars and especially the recent french and indian war had taught both the men and officers the value of irregular warfare while many british troops fresh from europe were less familiar with this the wilderness terrain that lay just beyond many colonial towns very familiar to the local minuteman favored this style of combat the rifled musket used by most minutemen was also well suited to this role the rifling grooves inside the barrel gave it a much greater range than the smoothbore musket although it took much longer to load because of the lower rate of fire rifles weren t used by regular infantry but were preferred for hunting when performing as skirmishers the minutemen could fire and fall back behind cover or other troops before the british could get into range the increased range and accuracy of the rifle along with a lifetime of hunting to develop marksmanship earned minutemen sharpshooters a deadly reputation ammunition and supplies were not only in short demand but were constantly being seized by british patrols as a precaution these items were often hidden or left behind by minutemen in fields or wooded areas other popular concealment methods were to hide items underneath floorboards in houses and barns legacy concord minuteman in commemoration of the centenary of the first successful armed resistance to british forces daniel chester french in his first major commission produced one of his most well known statues along with the lincoln memorial the concord minuteman inscribed on the pediment is the opening stanza of ralph waldo emerson s one eight three seven concord hymn with the immortal words shot heard round the world traditionally the statue s likeness is

derived from the word metzuda meaning fortress it is the site of ancient palaces and fortifications in israel on top of an isolated rock plateau on the eastern edge of the judean desert overlooking the dead sea masada became famous for the seven three ce battle one of the last in the great jewish revolt between the site s jewish defenders and besieging roman troops during which almost all surviving defenders committed mass suicide when defeat became imminent geography masada seen from the east dovecote at masada where ashes were probably stored the openings have been shown to be too small for pigeons to fit the cliffs on the east edge of masada are about four five zero meters high dropping off to the dead sea and the cliffs on the west are about one zero zero meters high the natural approaches to the cliff top are very difficult the top of the plateau is flat and rhomboid shaped approximately six zero zero by three zero zero meters there was a casemate wall around the top of the plateau totalling one four zero zero meters long and four meters thick with many towers and the fortress included storehouses cisterns that were refilled by rainwater barracks palaces and an armory three narrow winding paths led from below to fortified gates location history according to flavius josephus a one st century jewish historian herod the great fortified masada between three seven and three one bce as a refuge for himself should his jewish subjects rise up against him in six six ce at the beginning of the great jewish revolt against the romans a group of jewish rebels called the zealots heb kana im lit jealous ones commanded by elazar ben ya ir took masada from the roman garrison stationed there in seven zero ce they were joined by additional zealots and their families who were expelled from jerusalem by the other jews living there shortly before the destruction of jerusalem and for the next two years used masada as their base for raiding and harassing roman and jewish settlements alike remnants of one of several legionary camps at masada just outside the circumvallation wall which can be seen next to it then in seven two ce the roman governor of iudaea province lucius flavius silva marched against masada with the roman legion x fretensis and laid siege to the fortress after failed attempts to breach the wall they built a circumvallation wall and then a rampart against the western face of the plateau using thousands of tons of stones and beaten earth josephus does not record any major attempts by the zealots to counterattack the besiegers during this process a significant difference from his accounts of other sieges against jewish fortresses suggesting that perhaps the zealots lacked the equipment or skills to fight the roman legion it is believed by many that the romans used jewish slaves to build the rampart whom the zealots were reluctant to kill because of their beliefs a shot of the ramp from the top the ramp was complete in the spring of seven three ce after approximately two to three months of siege allowing the romans to finally breach the wall of the fortress with a battering ram when they entered the fortress however the romans discovered that its approximately one thousand defenders had set all the buildings but the food storerooms ablaze and committed mass suicide rather than face certain capture or defeat by their enemies because the jewish religion discourages the act of suicide however the defenders were reported to have drawn lots and slain each other in turn down to the last man who would be the only one to actually take his own life as per josephus account the argument is made that the storerooms were left standing to show that the defenders retained the ability to live and chose the time of their death this account of the siege of masada was apparently related to josephus by two women who survived the suicide by hiding inside a cistern along with five children and repeated elazar ben yair s final exortation to his followers prior to the mass suicide verbatim to the romans the site today platform access to the fortress the site of masada was identified in one eight four two and
